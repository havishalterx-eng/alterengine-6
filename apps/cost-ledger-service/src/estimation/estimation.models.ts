/**
 * OUT-6: pre-execution cost estimation. No formal request/response shape
 * exists in doc 05 (API spec) or doc 04 (data model) for this endpoint --
 * genuinely new design, disclosed in the PR. Real, deliberate choices:
 *
 * - Callers supply the planned cost-driving line items directly (source/
 *   provider/resource/expected_quantity) rather than this service parsing
 *   a compiled DAG itself -- keeps cost-ledger-service decoupled from
 *   orchestration_db's DAG shape (no cross-database join, doc 04 SS1), the
 *   caller (whichever service starts a run) already has the compiled DAG
 *   and can derive these line items from it.
 * - Only `internal_cost_minor` is estimated -- `billable_minor`/
 *   `margin_minor` need OUT-5's pricing/margin model, which doesn't exist
 *   yet. Disclosed known gap, not silently omitted.
