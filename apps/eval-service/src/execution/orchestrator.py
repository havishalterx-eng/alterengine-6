"""Real eval-run orchestration (HARD-7).

Every golden set built by HARD-1..6 is real seeded data with a real
scoring contract, but nothing before this ticket ever executed a case
against the real system and persisted a real eval_runs/eval_results row --
confirmed by reading every prior Hardening PR (launch_golden_sets.py's own
docstring: "data for a future runner, not an evaluation implementation").

HARD-7a wired 'verification' for real, via a real gRPC call to
verification-service's ScoreNodeInline. HARD-7b adds 'planner' for its
select_strategy operation only, via a real HTTP call to intelligence-
service's PlannerService.SelectStrategy route (that kernel is pure --
no ADS/LLM I/O). HARD-7c adds 'retrieval', via a real gRPC call to
ads-core's AdsqService.Retrieve, against a real seeded corpus (see
apps/ads-core/src/query/eval_grpc_server.py) -- real hybrid retrieval, a
disclosed non-production embedding technique (no live embedding provider
reachable here). HARD-7e adds 'intent', via a real gRPC call to
orchestration-service's ConversationService.ClassifyIntent (see
apps/orchestration-service/src/eval_intent_grpc_server.ts) -- this one
depends on a real, live model-gateway (HARD-7d's eval_bootstrap.ts) with a
real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/OPENAI_API_KEY; without one, this domain's calls
fail for a real reason (no live credentials), not a harness bug. HARD-7f
adds 'injection', which spans three genuinely different real mechanisms
per suite (see security_client.py's own module doc): 'injection'/
'jailbreak' -> the same real, live LLM path as intent (via
eval_security_http_server.ts's PromptInjectionClassifier wiring);
'ssrf' -> pure, deterministic IP-blocklist logic, no LLM needed; 'upload'
-> ads-core's real, existing production presign route, not eval-only
scaffolding.
HARD-7g adds 'tenant-isolation' for 2 of its real 20 cases (this domain
is far more fragmented than the others -- 20 cases, ~12 different real
services, each its own isolation mechanism; most are disclosed follow-up,
not built here): 'ads_retrieve' (real Postgres RLS -- a query for
tenant-b's uniquely-worded probe document, issued under tenant-a's own
valid scope, must never return that document; ads-core's real Retrieve
RPC always returns top_k candidates rather than a literally empty list,
so "empty_result" here means "the tenant-b probe never appears", the
real security property under test, not a literal array-length check) and
'tool_resolve_credential' (real, pure ownership check in tool-gateway's
production ResolveCredential -- no eval-only entrypoint needed, the
cross-tenant case throws before ever touching a real secrets provider).
A HARD-7g follow-up adds 'platform_credential_get'/'platform_credential_
delete' (real, unmodified CredentialController + CredentialService +
CredentialRepository from platform-api -- the first eval-only entrypoint
in this campaign targeting platform-api, not orchestration-service; see
apps/platform-api/src/eval_credential_http_server.ts's own module doc).
The real "not_found" behavior comes entirely from CredentialRepository's
own tenant-scoped SQL.
A second HARD-7g follow-up adds 'tool_consume_credential' (real, in-memory
#credentialTokens ownership check inside ToolGatewayService.invokeTool()'s
#resolveCredentialReference -- unlike tool_resolve_credential, this case
needs a real ResolveCredential call to actually SUCCEED first, as tenant-b,
to mint a real opaque token, before InvokeTool is called as tenant-a with
that token. Production main.js's own default mock SecretsProvider seeds
only one fixed, unscoped secret key, which can never simultaneously satisfy
the real tenant/integration ownership check AND resolve as a real secret,
so this is the first tool-gateway eval-only entrypoint in this campaign:
apps/tool-gateway/src/eval_credential_grpc_server.ts reuses AppModule.
register() and ToolGatewayService completely unmodified, seeding the same
real mock SecretsProvider with one additional real key equal to the test's
own credential_ref. The real cross-tenant "not owned" denial comes entirely
from the real, unmodified #resolveCredentialReference tenant check.
A third follow-up adds 'idempotency_replay': two instances of
eval_credential_http_server.ts, one per tenant, sharing one real Postgres,
both hitting the same real, tenant-scoped idempotency_keys table (see
idempotency_client.py's own module doc) -- proves tenant-b reusing the
exact same Idempotency-Key tenant-a already used is never short-circuited
by tenant-a's cached record.
A fourth follow-up adds 'ads_get_ingestion_job': ads-core's real,
unmodified production FastAPI app (src.main:app) run directly via uvicorn
-- no eval-only entrypoint needed (see ingestion_client.py's own module
doc). The real cross-tenant 404 comes entirely from
SqlAlchemyIngestionRepository's own real RLS-scoped session.
A fifth follow-up adds 'policy_read': memory-service's real, unmodified
production FastAPI app (src.main:app) run directly via uvicorn -- no
eval-only entrypoint needed (see policy_client.py's own module doc). The
real cross-tenant "empty_result" (found=False) comes entirely from
SqlAlchemyPolicyStoreRepository.get_active_policy()'s own real,
RLS-scoped session.
A sixth follow-up adds 'recovery_node_lookup' and 'run_stream_subscribe':
apps/orchestration-service/src/eval_run_visibility_http_server.ts, a real
eval-only entrypoint reusing NodeExecutionsController/RunStreamController
unmodified (see its own module doc). Both cases were originally seeded
with expected outcome "denied", but the real backing mechanism for both
(NodeExecutionLedgerService.list()'s and RunStreamEventService.
runIsVisible()'s identical explicit `WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND id = $2`
checks) is a resource-visibility check, not an authorization denial --
the golden set's expected_json was corrected to "not_found" to match
what the real system actually does (see remaining_golden_sets.py).
A seventh follow-up adds 'model_gateway_cache': model-gateway's real
semantic cache (ModelGatewayService's #lookupCacheBestEffort/
#storeCacheBestEffort) had no way to observe cache hit vs miss from
outside at all until now -- InvokeResponse's real proto gained a new
`cache_hit: bool` field (see model_cache_client.py's own module doc and
the proto's own comment) so this case can be tested against the real,
caller-visible API rather than internal state. Needs a real, live
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/OPENAI_API_KEY (same disclosed dependency as
'intent'/'injection') since the real cache is only ever populated by a
real live model call.
An eighth follow-up adds 'verification_score_node': verification-
service's real, unmodified production gRPC server (src.grpc_server) --
no eval-only entrypoint needed. Unlike ScoreNodeInline (HARD-7a's
target, a pure stateless kernel with no ownership concept at all),
AssessSeverity's real HallucinationVerificationEngine.assess_severity()
calls VerificationRepository.ensure_node(), a real, explicit,
tenant-scoped `WHERE ne.tenant_id = :tenant_id AND ...` check (see
verification_severity_client.py's own module doc) -- this raises before
ever reaching the real ModelGatewayClient call, so no live LLM key is
needed for this specific cross-tenant check. Golden set's expected_json
was corrected from "denied" to "not_found" to match the real mechanism
(same vocabulary fix as recovery_node_lookup/run_stream_subscribe).
A ninth follow-up adds 'audit_event_read': a new real GetEvent RPC on
AuditService (audit-service was write-only before this -- RecordEvent
only). AuditService.getEvent()'s real, explicit
`stored.tenantId !== request.tenant_id` check (audit.service.ts) makes a
cross-tenant read a real NOT_FOUND, deliberately indistinguishable from
an event that never existed. Uses apps/audit-service/src/eval_bootstrap.ts,
a real, disclosed eval-only entrypoint (production main.ts always needs
live AWS Secrets Manager access with no mock-config escape hatch;
AuditService/AuditGrpcController/PostgresAuditStoreProvider are all real
and unmodified -- see audit_client.py's own module doc).
A tenth follow-up adds 'memory_drift_observations': a new real GET-style
read route (POST /drift/agents/scores) on memory-service's real
DriftDetector/SqlAlchemyDriftRepository (previously write-only via
compute_agent_drift). The real cross-tenant "empty_result" is NOT an
app-level tenant check at all -- drift_scores' own `drift_read` RLS
policy (0001_create_policy_tables.py) only permits SELECT of
subject_type IN ('model','provider'); agent-subject rows are
deliberately default-deny for every tenant session pending KNOW-15's
local ownership projection, per that migration's own docstring (see
memory_drift_client.py's own module doc). No eval-only entrypoint
needed -- src.main:app run directly, same shape as policy_client.py's
target.
An eleventh follow-up adds 'ads_upload_download': ads-core's real,
unmodified production POST /ads/ingestion/uploads/complete. Unlike
ads_get_ingestion_job (a resource-visibility "not_found"), the real
cross-tenant mechanism here is an explicit 403 FORBIDDEN ("upload_key
does not belong to the requesting tenant" -- router.py's own upload_key
prefix check, evaluated before any object storage or DB call). Golden
set's expected_json was corrected from "not_found" to "denied" to match
-- the opposite vocabulary-fix direction from every other HARD-7g case
so far, because this one really is an authorization denial, not a
visibility check (see ingestion_client.py's own module doc, which also
fixes a real pre-existing bug: check_get/ads_get_ingestion_job's
unprefixed /ingestion/jobs/{id} path 404s unconditionally regardless of
real cross-tenant logic since the real router mounts under
prefix="/ads" -- this happened to coincide with the expected
"not_found" outcome, so the case appeared to pass without ever
exercising SqlAlchemyIngestionRepository's real RLS-scoped lookup).
A twelfth follow-up adds 'workflow_get'/'workflow_update': the real
`workflows` table (0000_create_workflows.sql, real tenant-scoped RLS
policy) has existed since Planning (PLAN-9) but had zero real reader or
writer anywhere in orchestration-service until now -- platform-api's
WorkflowController called a GET/PATCH /api/v1/workflows/:id route that
never existed on the engine side. Adds WorkflowReadService/
WorkflowReadController (real, minimal: read + name/status update only,
no etag/canvas/versions/validate/compile/simulate -- that's real,
larger production-feature scope platform-api's own controller already
half-implements, a disclosed separate follow-up). Uses
eval_workflow_read_http_server.ts, a real, disclosed eval-only
entrypoint reusing WorkflowReadController unmodified (same synthetic-
ActorContext shape as eval_run_visibility_http_server.ts -- production's
real SessionGatewayGuard needs live JWT signing keys not reachable
here). The real cross-tenant "not_found" comes from the `workflows`
table's own RLS policy plus WorkflowReadService's own explicit
`WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND id = $2` -- defense in depth, matching
run_visibility_client.py's shape (see workflow_client.py's own module
doc).
A thirteenth follow-up adds 'agent_selection_binding': the first case to
exercise SelectionBindingEngine.bind()'s real capability-similarity
ranked-match path, unblocked by the embedding-transport follow-up above
(GrpcEmbeddingClient). Real cross-tenant isolation comes from
`_RANKED_AGENT_QUERY`'s own explicit `WHERE a.tenant_id = :tenant_id
AND ce.tenant_id = :tenant_id` (engine.py) -- a tenant-a caller can
never see tenant-b's seeded agent/capability_embeddings row regardless
of capability-text similarity. bind() now auto-creates a fresh tenant-a
agent on a genuine no-match instead of stopping at NoAgentMatch, so the
real isolation signal is "the returned agent_id is never tenant-b's
seeded one" (see agent_binding_client.py's own module doc), not a bare
no-match anymore. Needs a real, live
model-gateway for the real embed() call to succeed, but only its
embedding provider, not its model provider -- production main.ts run
with ALTER_CONFIG_SOURCE=mock is sufficient (createMockEmbeddingProvider
is real, deterministic, disclosed non-production, same shape as
HARD-7c's retrieval golden set), so unlike model_gateway_cache/intent/
injection this needs no live ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/OPENAI_API_KEY (see
agent_binding_client.py's own module doc).
A fourteenth follow-up adds 'project_get'/'project_deploy': unlike
workflows, NO real schema existed anywhere for a "project"/"deployment"
resource on orchestration-service (confirmed by grepping its own
migrations and service code) -- this needed a genuinely new migration
(0019_create_projects.sql: real, RLS-scoped `projects` and `deployments`
tables, same tenant-immutability trigger/policy shape as every other
table in this schema), not just a controller. Adds ProjectReadService/
ProjectReadController (real, deliberately minimal: read + a deploy
action that creates a real, tenant-scoped `deployments` row -- no
builds/tests/previews/audit-results/versions/rollback, all of which are
real, larger production-feature scope platform-api's own
ProjectOperationsController already models on its side, a disclosed
separate follow-up). Uses eval_project_read_http_server.ts, a real,
disclosed eval-only entrypoint reusing ProjectReadController unmodified
(same synthetic-ActorContext shape as every other eval-only entrypoint
in this campaign). The real cross-tenant "not_found" comes from the
tables' own RLS policies plus ProjectReadService's own explicit
`WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND id = $2` -- defense in depth, matching
workflow_client.py's shape (see project_client.py's own module doc).
With this, all 20 of 20 tenant-isolation cases HARD-7g targeted are
real.
HARD-7h adds 'project' (project-E2E, 3/3 real cases): a real call to
intelligence-service's PlannerService.Decompose with
strategy=plan_then_execute, reusing HARD-7b's exact same real HTTP
server unchanged. build_project_skeleton() is pure and deterministic
(fixed 14-stage pipeline, see project_strategy.py's own module doc) --
the real GrpcAdsClient.retrieve() call decompose() always makes first
degrades to empty hits either way here (empty scope_ids always trips
ads-core's real ScopeViolationError, and GrpcAdsClient's own disclosed
fail-open catches exactly that), so no ADS backend is even needed for
this specific real path.
planner's decompose/replan operations for the 'planner' domain's
non-project strategies still need real ADS+LLM wiring, deliberately left
real-failing (never silently skipped) -- same disclosed-gap pattern as
the remaining domains (most of tenant-isolation), each its own follow-up.
HARD-7i adds 'recovery' for 5 of its 15 real cases: the ones whose real
dispatch (RecoveryDispatchService.dispatch()) never touches Temporal, a
live LLM, or Planner -- "ask_user" (real DB-backed approvals row) and
"swap_agent" (a real, disclosed "no target system wired yet" deferred
outcome). See apps/orchestration-service/src/eval_recovery_grpc_server.ts
and recovery_client.py's own module docs: the real recovery_actions row
SelectStrategy needs is seeded directly via SQL (bypassing
ClassifyFailure's real, live ADVANCED-tier Model Gateway call), same
shortcut shape as ads-core's document seeding. The other 10 cases
(retry/backoff need a real Temporal signal, escalate_model needs a real
live LLM, replan/recompile need a real Planner call, 3 policy-override
cases need none of those but aren't dispatch-light either) are disclosed
follow-up, not built here.
HARD-7j adds 'workflow' (workflow-E2E) for 1 of its 5 real cases:
'register_trigger', via the real, unmodified TriggerRegistryController +
TriggerRegistryService (see eval_trigger_registry_http_server.ts's own
module doc -- production's real SessionGatewayGuard needs live JWT
signing keys not reachable here, so a synthetic ActorContext is injected
in its place; the real registerTrigger business logic itself is
untouched). workflowVersionId has no real FK to any workflow_versions
row (a real, disclosed gap in trigger-registry.service.ts itself, not
introduced here) -- only a real `workflows` row is needed.
'create_save_workflow'/'simulate_workflow' are a real, structural dead
end, not a "needs more infra" gap: platform-api's WorkflowService calls
POST /api/v1/workflows and .../actions/simulate on orchestration-service,
but orchestration-service serves neither route anywhere -- a genuine
missing production feature, flagged as its own separate follow-up
ticket, not an eval-wiring problem. 'clarify_then_replan'/'run_gate' were
deliberately not investigated further (real classes exist for both, but
chasing every remaining operation's exact real backend has hit
diminishing returns after 7f/7g/7i's fragmentation).
See EvalRunOrchestrator.run()'s domain check and _score_case's operation
dispatch.
