"""The canonical tools and whether each acts on the outside world.

packages/contracts/src/tool-names.ts (ToolNameSchema) is the source of truth
for the names; tests/test_canonical_tools.py fails if this list drifts from it.
The tool gateway dispatches exactly these, so a tool name outside this list
cannot run.

Each tool is registered in the Capability Registry as a global record whose
only capability is ``tool.<name>`` (migration 0008), and the resolver gives a
ToolCall node that capability. That is how a tool node's side effects reach
synthesis, which approves only actions that may have them.

Read-only means the call cannot send, create, change or delete anything,
here or elsewhere. When in doubt a tool has side effects:
browser.navigate can trigger state-changing GET endpoints, and opening or
closing a browser session is not a read.
