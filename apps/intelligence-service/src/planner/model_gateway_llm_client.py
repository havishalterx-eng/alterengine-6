"""Real Model Gateway-backed LlmClient.

Implements generate_skeleton() for real -- the typed ProblemSpec ->
TaskSkeleton path the Planner's default (non plan_then_execute,
non manager_worker) strategy uses -- and classify_workflow_strategy(), which
chooses a workflow objective's strategy. revise_skeleton and
generate_manager_worker_plan still defer to StubLlmClient's deterministic
behavior; those are separate, disclosed follow-ups, not part of this real path.

Same real gRPC-call pattern as verification-service's GrpcModelGatewayClient
(apps/verification-service/src/verification/model_gateway_client.py):
plain messages[] Invoke call against alter.modelgw.v1.ModelgwService, no
vendor SDK here -- the real Model Gateway adapter is the only thing that
ever names a concrete model.

_SKELETON_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a task planner. Decompose the validated ProblemSpec JSON
into a task skeleton: a small DAG of steps needed to accomplish it.

Respond with a single JSON object only, no other text, no markdown code fences. The object \
must have this exact shape:
{
  "version": "1",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "key": "<unique_snake_case_id, must start with a letter>",
      "type": "<llm|tool|branch|join>",
      "config": { ... },
      "depends_on": ["<key of node this depends on>", ...],
      "success_criteria": ["<exact success criterion assigned to this node>", ...]
    }
  ],
  "entry_point": "<key of the first node, must have depends_on: []>"
}

Rules for config, by node type:
- "llm": config must have "model_alias" (one of FAST, STANDARD, ADVANCED, CEILING -- use \
STANDARD unless the step clearly needs more reasoning) and "prompt" (a specific, self-\
contained instruction for that step). The model executing this step will be told to \
respond with JSON only, so the prompt should describe what fields the JSON output needs.
- "tool": config must have "tool_name" (a short, descriptive snake_case name for the \
external action, e.g. "youtube_upload", "video_render") and "arguments" (an object of \
whatever parameters that tool call needs).
- "branch" and "join": config can be an empty object {}.

Keep the plan small and concrete -- 2 to 6 nodes. Every node's dependencies must reference \
real node keys in the same skeleton. Exactly one node must have depends_on: [] and must \
match entry_point. For every string in the input ProblemSpec's success_criteria, assign that \
exact unchanged string to one or more node success_criteria lists. Do not omit, rewrite, invent, \
or copy every criterion onto every node."""

# Written from the strategy definitions in strategies.py. It deliberately

# this prompt, so wording copied from it would score the copy, not the model.
_STRATEGY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You decide how a workflow objective should be executed. \
Judge the work the objective actually requires, not how the request is worded: length, \
politeness, list formatting and particular verbs are not evidence either way.

Choose exactly one strategy:

- "direct": the whole objective is a single step. One action or one answer completes it, \
and there is no intermediate result that has to be checked before the work is done.

- "iterative": one line of work with several steps. Later steps depend on what earlier \
steps produce, or a result has to be checked before continuing -- for example finding a \
cause before acting on it, making a change and then confirming nothing broke, or \
repeating an adjustment until a goal is met. A list of steps that happen in order on the \
same piece of work is iterative, however many steps it names.

- "manager_worker": several substantial workstreams that are independent of each other \
and can run in parallel under one coordinator -- such as the same large job carried out \
separately for different teams, sites, markets or languages, or distinct large \
deliverables that do not wait on one another. The workstreams do not need to be listed \
individually; a count or a phrase covering many of them is enough when each one is a \
substantial job on its own.

If unsure between "direct" and "iterative", choose "iterative". Choose "manager_worker" \
only when the parallel, independent workstreams are clear.

Respond with a single JSON object only, no other text, no markdown code fences:
{"strategy": "<direct|iterative|manager_worker>", "reason": "<one sentence>"}"""
