"""Real Model Gateway-backed LlmClient.

Every LlmClient operation is real here:

- generate_skeleton: ProblemSpec -> TaskSkeleton for direct/iterative work.
- classify_workflow_strategy: chooses a workflow objective's strategy.
- revise_skeleton: rewrites a skeleton around a failed node, for Recovery's
  replan strategy.
- generate_manager_worker_plan: splits an objective into a manager brief and
  independent parallel workers.

Model output is untrusted. Revised skeletons and manager/worker plans are
checked for what the compiler and node handlers will later require (see
_executable_problems and _manager_worker_plan), so a plan that cannot run
fails here with its reason rather than at compile or execution time.

Same real gRPC-call pattern as verification-service's GrpcModelGatewayClient
(apps/verification-service/src/verification/model_gateway_client.py):
plain messages[] Invoke call against alter.modelgw.v1.ModelgwService, no
vendor SDK here -- the real Model Gateway adapter is the only thing that
ever names a concrete model.

- "iterative": one line of work with several steps. Later steps depend on what earlier \
steps produce, or a result has to be checked before continuing -- for example finding a \
cause before acting on it, making a change and then confirming nothing broke, or \
repeating an adjustment until a goal is met. A list of steps that happen in order on the \
same piece of work is iterative, however many steps it names.
