"""Workflow strategy selection.

Four strategies exist on the planner:
- DIRECT           -- single-step execution, no decomposition required.
- ITERATIVE        -- multi-step with intermediate validation gates.
- PLAN_THEN_EXECUTE -- full decomposition first, batch execution after approval
                       (always used for mode="project"; see project_strategy.py).
- MANAGER_WORKER   -- objective spans several independent large workstreams;
                       fanned out to parallel worker agents under one manager
                       (see manager_worker.py). Only escalated to from
                       mode="workflow" -- Project-mode work always needs its
                       fixed build pipeline regardless of scale, so it is
                       never overridden by this escalation.

SelectStrategy is a deterministic heuristic; it never calls the LLM.  The
heuristic is intentionally conservative: when in doubt, choose a more
deliberate strategy to avoid silent failures during execution.
