--     query against a single part and falls as the requirement grows:
--     measured 0.77 for two capabilities, 0.75 for three, 0.51 for four. A
--     four-capability requirement therefore could not bind an agent
--     declaring all four, and fell through to auto-creation, minting a
--     duplicate every attempt -- the sprawl #125 and #157 closed, through a
--     different door.
--
-- What the floors were guarding is now guarded by containment: an agent that
-- does not declare the capability is not a candidate at all. One that
-- declares it but carries a stale embedding still binds, and ranks below
-- agents whose embeddings agree with it -- the right answer, because the
-- published capability list, not the vector, is what the agent promised.
