"""Internal service authentication — drop-in for every Python service.

Closes the callee half of findings 1 and 6: an internal endpoint must prove its
caller is a real Alter service before it acts on anything the caller says.

Mechanism is deliberately the one already proven in this repository —
`apps/ads-core/src/deletion/router.py:58-66`: a shared service token compared
as SHA-256 with `hmac.compare_digest`. No new dependency, no JWKS fetch, one
environment variable per service. It is the smallest change that is actually
correct, and it can ship without waiting on Auth0 M2M applications.

WHAT THIS GIVES YOU
    Authentication: the caller holds the service credential.

WHAT IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU
    Per-caller identity. Every service presents the same token, so this cannot
    tell orchestration-service from eval-service. Caller granularity comes from
    the per-service security groups in ../../02-per-service-security-groups.patch
    — the two layers compose: the security group says *which* service may
    connect, this token says *that it is a service at all*.

    When Auth0 M2M applications exist per service, replace `verify_service_token`
    with RS256 verification mirroring `packages/auth/session-gateway/src/m2m-validator.ts`
    (same issuer/audience/exp/nbf checks) and keep every call site unchanged.

ON TENANT IDENTITY — a correction worth stating plainly:
    An earlier draft of the review said "derive tenant_id from the credential,
    never from the request". That is right for a user-facing edge and WRONG for
    these internal services, which are legitimately called on behalf of many
    tenants by a trusted caller. The real defect was never that tenant_id
    travels on the wire — it is that nobody checked whether the caller was
    entitled to assert it. Authenticate the asserter and the message-borne
    tenant becomes sound. `require_tenant` below therefore validates format and
    binds against a tenant claim when one exists, rather than banning the field.
