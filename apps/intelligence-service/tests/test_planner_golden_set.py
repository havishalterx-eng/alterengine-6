"""Planning-phase exit check 4: a minimal, real, executable golden set.

This is NOT Hardening's future golden set (HARD-2 owns the 20-case,
threshold-graded planner golden set against real thresholds). This is a
small, real, deterministic set of objective -> expected-outcome cases
proving the mechanism itself is executable: select_strategy's four real
strategies, and PlannerKernel.decompose's real ambiguity heuristic. Runs
against the real StubAdsClient/StubLlmClient (no live Bedrock/Anthropic
credentials in this sandbox), same as every other planner test in this
suite.
