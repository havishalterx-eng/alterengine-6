 * same failure class forever.
 *
 * Known gap: `RootCauseEstimateSchema` (the locked HEAL-5 -> HEAL-6
 * handoff) does not persist HEAL-3's optional `safety_severity` signal --
 * only `FailureObservationSchema` carries it, and that observation is not
 * stored on `recovery_actions`. Auto-terminating on "critical" severity
 * therefore has no real data to read at this point and is NOT implemented
 * here: every `safety_violation` routes to `ask_user` so a human makes the
 * terminate call, rather than this table guessing at a severity it can't
 * see. Carrying `safety_severity` through to `recovery_actions` is a
 * disclosed follow-up, not something to invent silently here.
 *
 * `policy` is optional and, when present, real: a rule found for this
 * failure_class in `policy.rules` overrides the hardcoded default below,
 * and the returned `policyId`/`policyVersion` reflect that real promoted
 * policy row, not the fallback constants. No rule for this failure_class
 * (or no `policy` at all -- e.g. the caller never reached memory-service,
 * or the seeded row's own body has no override) falls through to the
 * exact same deterministic `decide()` this function has always used.
 * This is the real wiring: promoting a new active policy version with a
 * different `rules[failure_class]` measurably changes what this function
 * returns on the very next call, no restart or redeploy needed.
