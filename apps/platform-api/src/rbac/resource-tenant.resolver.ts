/**
 * Was RequestParamTenantResolver: for a workspaceId route param it looked
 * the tenant up in an in-memory Map that rbac.module.ts's production
 * wiring constructed with zero entries (`new RequestParamTenantResolver()`)
 * -- meaning RbacGuard's tenant-mismatch check silently never fired for any
 * of the 24 controllers gated by @RequireWorkspaceRole. Real bug, not a
 * cosmetic one: an actor could pass any workspaceId in the URL and the
 * "does this workspace belong to your tenant" check just never ran.
 *
 * Now resolves the workspace's real owning tenant with a real query,
 * scoped to the REQUESTING ACTOR's own tenant (the same RLS mechanism
 * every other tenant-scoped query in this app already uses via
 * PlatformDb.queryTenant, not a separate bypass-RLS read). If the
 * workspace belongs to a different tenant, RLS filters the row out and
 * this legitimately sees zero rows back -- "doesn't exist" and "isn't
 * yours" collapse to the same signal, which is correct here and avoids
 * leaking whether a workspace ID that isn't the caller's even exists.
 *
 * A tenantId/tenant_id route param is handled differently: there the
 * resource named by the URL already IS the tenant, so returning it
 * directly (for RbacGuard to compare against the actor's own tenant_id)
 * is the real check, not a lookup -- unlike the workspace case, there was
 * nothing to fix here.
