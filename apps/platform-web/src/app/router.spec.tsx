// Smoke test for the /app/admin subtree's lazy-loading (perf finding:
// platform-web shipped one ~1.4MB main bundle with almost no code-splitting
// -- see router.tsx). A missing/wrong Suspense boundary here fails silently
// as a blank screen rather than a build error, so this renders the real
// exported router, navigates it to /app/admin the same way a real user
// would, and asserts the lazily-loaded AdminLayout shell actually reaches
// the DOM past the Suspense boundary that wraps it.
