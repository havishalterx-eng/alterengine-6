"""Verification & Quality Gate kernel: ADVANCED-tier reviewer scoring.

Implements the one operation exposed by alter.verification.v1.VerificationService:
  - score_node -- node output -> verdict/score/threshold/reviewer_model/details

Independent per-node-type grading (HEAL-2): content-bearing node types
(LLMTask, ToolCall, SandboxExec, Synthesis) are judged by an ADVANCED-tier
reviewer against a rubric tailored to that node type. Deterministic/
control-flow node types (Gate, Merge, PubSub, HumanApproval, GroupChat,
YAMLImport, MemoryWrite) get a structural completeness check instead --
an LLM judgment call on a boolean routing decision is meaningless, and
Sandbox Service already owns SandboxExec's build/render/placeholder gates
(different gate_types, EXEC-11/13) -- this kernel only adds the "quality"
gate_type on top of those.

All external I/O (the reviewer LLM) is injected; the kernel itself is pure
Python and has no side effects beyond calling that injected collaborator.
It does not persist to verification_results -- that table lives in
orchestration_db (a different service's database per the one-DB-per-service
rule); the caller (Executor/NodeexecService) owns writing this response
into that table, the same way NodeexecService owns node_executions writes.
