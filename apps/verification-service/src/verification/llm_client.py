"""LLM client contract and stub for the ADVANCED-tier reviewer.

The Verification & Quality Gate calls the Model Gateway
(alter.modelgw.v1.ModelgwService) for its reviewer scoring. The real gRPC
client lives in packages/adapters (vendor-SDK rule); this module defines
only the Protocol the verification kernel depends on and a
contract-complete stub that returns deterministic responses -- same
pattern as apps/intelligence-service/src/planner/llm_client.py.

Wire the stub during development. Swap in the real adapter at integration
time without touching kernel.py.
