# Alter Engine — Component Contracts

Per-component contracts for the ground-up rebuild. Companion to `alter-engine-rebuild-design-log.md`, which holds the product and architecture decisions these contracts implement. Read the design log first; this document assumes its 28 locked sections.

**Status:** in progress. Contracts are written and revised here as one document; once stable they become the per-component READMEs in the new repo (design log Section 6 — one folder per component). Keeping them in one file while they are still moving makes cross-component contradictions cheap to find and fix.

Started: 2026-09-01.

## Contract template

Every component gets these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **INPUT** | What it accepts, and from which *named* component — never "upstream" |
| **OUTPUT** | What it produces, and to which named component |
| **CALL TYPE** | sync (blocks caller) / async (fire, event later) / side-channel (plane call, off the request path) |
| **DRIVER** | What actually invokes it — a caller, a schedule, an event — plus the test asserting that driver exists |
| **FAILURE TARGET** | Which component Recovery reaches back to when this one fails |
| **BLAST RADIUS** | nothing / degraded (self only) / this-layer-only / whole-engine |
| **FAIL MODE** | fail-closed (refuse safely) / fail-open (continue with default, must log loudly) |
| **PLANE DEPS** | Which cross-cutting planes it touches |
| **NON-RESPONSIBILITIES** | What this component must explicitly *not* do — the boundary it is forbidden to cross |
| **DONE GATE** | What proves this component actually works, tested against real execution |

**Why NON-RESPONSIBILITIES is a field and not a comment:** the old architecture document contained boundary warnings in prose ("keep Conversation Manager focused on intent, do not let it become the Planner") that were honored on paper and violated in code. Making the forbidden boundary an explicit, per-component field means scope creep is a contract violation rather than a matter of interpretation.

**Why DRIVER and BLAST RADIUS / FAIL MODE exist as mandatory fields:** they close two of the old build's four systemic patterns (design log Section 7) at design time rather than at audit time. The old build repeatedly shipped correct machinery that nothing ever called — a dispatch queue with no scheduler, an audit verifier with zero callers, a promotion gate that only ran when a human typed a command. Requiring a named driver plus a test that the driver exists makes that class of defect impossible to introduce silently.

---

## L1 — Front Door

### 1. Identity & Tenant Gateway

*Establishes who is making this request, which tenant they belong to, and what they are permitted to do — before anything else sees the request.*

**INPUT** — two distinct modes:
- *Human request:* bearer token (JWT from the managed identity provider, design log Section 20), arriving from Platform API/BFF.
- *Trigger-originated:* no human actor present. Event & Trigger Gateway passes a workflow reference; tenant is derived from workflow ownership (Section 22 — the engine owns workflow-ownership facts, not the Platform).

**OUTPUT** — `ActorContext { tenant_id, actor_id (user or system), roles, resolved_permissions, workspace_scope }`, consumed by Conversation Manager, Run Manager, and every downstream component requiring tenant scope.

> **Non-negotiable:** `resolved_permissions` must be *derived from roles* (the 10 toggles in Section 15). The old build hardcoded `permissions: []` in exactly this component, making 101 endpoints return 403 to every real user — and its unit test passed because it injected permissions directly, a state no real request could ever produce.

**CALL TYPE** — sync. Every request blocks on it.

**DRIVER** — invoked per-request by Platform API/BFF; invoked per-trigger-fire by Event & Trigger Gateway.
*Driver test:* a real request travels end-to-end through both guards and arrives downstream with a non-empty permission set.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none. Runs before a run exists, so Recovery does not apply. Failure means the request is rejected.

**BLAST RADIUS** — whole-engine. Legitimately so: if this is unavailable, nothing works. One of very few components permitted this rating.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed, absolutely. Deny whenever identity or permissions cannot be established.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (JWT validation), Observability, Audit (authentication events), Type/Schema Contracts (`ActorContext` is a typed contract).

**DONE GATE** — six tests, five written directly against known old-build failures:
1. A real member with a real role produces a non-empty permission set, end-to-end — *the test the old build never had*.
2. Rejects: missing token, expired token, wrong issuer, wrong audience, `alg:none`, HS256-confusion.
3. An unknown `kid` does not trigger unbounded outbound JWKS fetches — negative cache plus rate limit (old build: unauthenticated amplification vector).
4. Rotated-out signing keys stop validating — the key map is *replaced* on refresh, never merged (old build: keys never evicted, so revocation silently did nothing).
5. A cross-tenant request is denied.
6. The trigger-originated path resolves tenant correctly with no human actor present.

---

### 2. Event & Trigger Gateway

*The engine's entry point for work that starts without a human typing — webhooks, scheduled triggers, inbound email, public form submissions. Validates, normalizes to a canonical Alter event, and durably records it.*

**INPUT** — inbound external signals:
- Webhook posts from external systems (Stripe, CRMs, messaging platforms)
- Public form submissions, forwarded from Public Surface (design log Section 25)
- Schedule fires (cron-style triggers)
- Any other registered trigger source

**OUTPUT** — a canonical Alter event, written durably, carrying: `{tenant_id, source, trigger_reference, workflow_reference, payload, timestamp, idempotency_key}`. Consumed by Run Manager, which picks it up independently.

**CALL TYPE** — **async handoff, decided explicitly.** The gateway validates, normalizes, writes durably, and acknowledges the external caller immediately. It does *not* wait for Run Manager to start a run.
- *Why:* external systems retry when responses are slow, so a synchronous handoff turns engine slowness into duplicate inbound deliveries — amplifying load exactly when the engine is already struggling.
- *Precedent:* the old build's audit rated its webhook receive path clean (HMAC over raw body, `timingSafeEqual`, replay rejection) but separately found its money-carrying consumer lost messages by deleting them on receipt before processing. The lesson is to decouple the receive boundary from the processing boundary, with durability in between.
- *Accepted consequence:* the acknowledgment means "accepted," not "completed." Fine for webhooks; for a public form submission the person sees a received-confirmation rather than a finished result.

**DRIVER** — external callers drive the webhook and form paths. **Scheduled triggers need their own driver** — a real scheduler, not an incidental one.
*Driver test:* a scheduled trigger fires on time with no other activity in the system. This is precisely the old build's Pattern 3 failure (a dispatch queue whose only driver was the next unrelated launch); the test must prove the scheduler exists and runs unprompted.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none for validation failures (the request is rejected at the boundary). If durable write fails, the external caller receives a failure so *it* retries — the engine never silently absorbs an event it did not record.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. If it is down, new external work cannot enter the engine, but in-flight runs continue unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Reject signals that fail validation, signature verification, or durable write. Never accept-and-hope.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (signature verification, untrusted input handling), Observability, Audit (every accepted and rejected signal), Type/Schema Contracts (canonical event shape).

**DONE GATE**
1. A scheduled trigger fires on time with nothing else happening in the system — *the driver-exists test*.
2. Webhook signature verification: valid signatures accepted, invalid rejected, using constant-time comparison over the raw body.
3. Replay rejected — the same event delivered twice produces one run, via the idempotency key.
4. A durable-write failure returns an error to the caller rather than a false acknowledgment.
5. Acknowledgment latency stays flat while Run Manager is slow or unavailable — proving the decoupling is real.
6. Tenant is correctly resolved from the trigger's workflow reference, with no human actor present.

---

### 3. Conversation Manager

*Reads what the user is actually asking for, classifies it, and tracks the active goal across the conversation — including across pause and resume.*

**Boundary decision (settled here):** three components could plausibly hold "conversation" data. They divide as:
- **This component** — *live state*: recent turns, current active goal, pending clarification, for the session being handled right now.
- **46. Workspace & Workflow Management** — *mapping and metadata*: which sessions exist, which workflow each is, which folder it sits in (design log Section 10).
- **5. ADS Store** — *long-term retrievable context*, semantically searchable across all of a user's workflows (Section 10's cross-workflow context requirement).

**INPUT** — a user message, plus `ActorContext` from **1. Identity & Tenant Gateway**.

**OUTPUT** — `{intent classification, active goal state}`. Intent taxonomy: *answer a question · build a new workflow · modify an existing workflow · run something now · check status · clarify a prior turn.* For build and modify intents, the conversation is handed to **4. ADS Client** for context loading, then to **6. Problem Understanding**.

**CALL TYPE** — sync. A human is waiting on the response.

**DRIVER** — invoked per user message by **48. Platform API/BFF**.
*Driver test:* a message sent through the real Platform API arrives here, is classified, and the classification reaches the next component.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none at this stage; no run exists yet. A failure returns an error to the user rather than entering Recovery.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). If this is unavailable, users cannot start or modify workflows — but **in-flight runs continue unaffected**, because the run path never touches it (design log Section 24, two-path model). This is the two-path model paying off concretely: a design-path outage must not stop the run path.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed on ambiguity. When intent cannot be confidently classified, ask the user (route to **8. Clarification Loop**) rather than guessing. Guessing here silently misroutes the entire downstream pipeline.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (prompt-injection screening on user input), Observability, Type/Schema Contracts, Cost Ledger (it makes model calls — FAST tier per the original spec).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not plan.** It classifies intent and tracks the goal; deciding *how* to solve the problem belongs to **7. Planner** and **10. Architecture Synthesizer**. This was an explicit warning in the old architecture document, and it is the single most likely scope creep in this component.
- Must not store long-term memory — that is **5. ADS Store**.
- Must not own session-to-workflow mapping or folder structure — that is **46. Workspace & Workflow Management**.

**DONE GATE**
1. Each intent in the taxonomy is correctly classified against real user messages — not mocked inputs.
2. A genuinely ambiguous message routes to clarification rather than producing a confident wrong classification.
3. Active goal survives pause and resume: a session reopened later continues with the correct goal state intact.
4. Planner is invoked only for genuine build/modify intents — never for a question or a status check.
5. **Blast-radius test:** with this component stopped, an already-scheduled workflow still triggers, runs, and completes.

---

## L2 — Context

### 4. ADS Client

*The only path to long-term context. Enforces that every retrieval carries proper tenant, workspace, and permission scope.*

**Why a separate accessor exists at all:** the original architecture's Rule 23 — no component may freely query long-term tenant data. Concentrating access in one component makes scoping a single enforceable choke point rather than a rule every caller must remember.

**INPUT** — a retrieval request from **6. Problem Understanding**, **7. Planner**, or a run-time RAG node via **21. Executor**, always accompanied by `ActorContext`.

**OUTPUT** — scoped, ranked context passages with provenance, returned to the caller.

**RETRIEVAL SCOPE — decided here:** default scope is **the current workflow**. Cross-workflow retrieval (design log Section 10) happens only when explicitly requested — by the user ("like my other workflow") or when Problem Understanding identifies a genuine relation. *Reason:* a user with fifty workflows would otherwise have relevant context buried under forty-nine irrelevant ones, degrading every query.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — called by Problem Understanding and Planner on the design path; called by RAG-type nodes through Executor on the run path.
*Driver test:* a real design-path request and a real run-path RAG node each retrieve through this component, with scope enforced in both.

**FAILURE TARGET** — on the run path, a retrieval failure is a node failure and enters **30. Recovery Policy Engine** classification. On the design path, it surfaces to the user.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Design work degrades (no prior context); runs containing RAG or memory nodes fail at those nodes; runs without them are unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed, on both axes. If scope cannot be established, refuse the query — never return unscoped data. If context cannot be retrieved during design, say so rather than silently designing against missing context.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (retrieval is tenant-data access), Type/Schema Contracts, Cost Ledger (embedding calls cost money).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not store anything — writing is **5. ADS Store**'s job.
- Must not interpret retrieved context; it returns passages, it does not reason about them.
- Must not permit a caller to bypass scoping, under any circumstances, including internal system callers.

**DONE GATE**
1. A cross-tenant retrieval attempt returns nothing and is logged — tested with two real tenants holding similar content.
2. Default scoping returns current-workflow context only; broadened scope returns cross-workflow context, and the difference is demonstrable.
3. A retrieval with missing or malformed scope is refused, not silently widened.
4. Provenance accompanies every returned passage.

---

### 5. ADS Store

*Holds long-term, semantically searchable context per tenant — the substrate ADS Client reads from.*

**INPUT** — content to index: distilled conversation history, workflow definitions and outcomes, user-uploaded documents (the RAG use case in design log Section 1), and run outcomes. Written by **4. ADS Client** and by ingestion paths.

**OUTPUT** — ranked passages with provenance and tenant scoping, to **4. ADS Client** only.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for queries; async for ingestion (indexing and embedding should never block a user).

**DRIVER** — queries driven by ADS Client. **Ingestion needs its own driver** — a real indexing worker, not an incidental one.
*Driver test:* content becomes retrievable after ingestion with nothing else prompting the system.

**FAILURE TARGET** — surfaces through ADS Client to its caller.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, same reasoning as ADS Client.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never return partial results silently as if complete.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Cost Ledger (embeddings), Safety & Policy (untrusted uploaded content), Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not be queried by anything except ADS Client — no direct access, no exceptions (Rule 23).
- Must not hold live run state — that is **22. Blackboard**.
- Must not hold learned policy — that is **33. Policy Store**.

**DONE GATE**
1. Ingested content is retrievable, verified against real documents rather than fixtures.
2. Tenant isolation holds at the storage layer, not only at the client — verified with two tenants holding near-identical content.
3. **Registered with 44. Deletion & Retention** (design log Section 28) — a tenant erasure provably removes their content and embeddings.
4. Chunking preserves sequence, and retrieval quality is measured against a real corpus rather than assumed. *(The old build's audit flagged missing chunk overlap and character-based rather than token-aware sizing.)*

---

### 6. Problem Understanding

*Converts an ambiguous human request plus retrieved context into a typed ProblemSpec — the structured input the Planner reasons from.*

**Critical linkage, easy to miss:** design log Section 5 requires that intake capture **explicit structured success criteria** before any workflow runs, because verification later checks against exactly that. This component is where those criteria are captured. **If this component is weak, the entire verification layer has nothing real to check against.** That makes it more load-bearing than its size suggests.

**INPUT** — classified intent and goal state from **3. Conversation Manager**, plus scoped context from **4. ADS Client**.

**OUTPUT** — a typed `ProblemSpec`: `{objective, current situation, actors, systems involved, constraints, required data, risk, missing information, success criteria}` → to **7. Planner**.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Conversation Manager for build and modify intents.
*Driver test:* a real build request produces a complete ProblemSpec that reaches the Planner.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none; no run exists yet. Missing information routes to **8. Clarification Loop** rather than failing.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Design path only; running workflows are unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An incomplete ProblemSpec — particularly one missing success criteria — must trigger clarification, never proceed to planning. Proceeding silently would leave verification with nothing to judge against, which is precisely the failure Section 5 was written to prevent.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (prompt injection in user-supplied objectives), Observability, Type/Schema Contracts (ProblemSpec is a core typed contract), Cost Ledger.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not decide *how* to solve the problem — that is **7. Planner** and **10. Architecture Synthesizer**. This component states the problem; it does not design the solution.
- Must not select tools, models, or agents.

**DONE GATE**
1. A real vague request produces a ProblemSpec with every field populated or explicitly marked missing.
2. **Success criteria are always captured** — a request lacking them cannot pass, it must trigger clarification. *(This is Section 5's precondition; without it, verification is unanchored.)*
3. Missing information routes to Clarification Loop rather than being invented.
4. ProblemSpec validates against its typed schema; a malformed one is rejected at the boundary.

---

## L3 — Alter Brain

*The moat layer. The four boundaries here are subtle and were explicitly ruled in the original architecture document (Rules 5–9); NON-RESPONSIBILITIES does the most work in this layer.*

### 7. Planner

*Decomposes a ProblemSpec into a task skeleton, flags ambiguity, and holds full replan authority.*

**INPUT** — `ProblemSpec` from **6. Problem Understanding** (design path), or a replan request from **30. Recovery Policy Engine** (run path).

**OUTPUT** — a task skeleton graph → to **9. Capability Resolver**.

**Two callers in two different paths — this is the crossing point.** Design log Section 24 established that the design path and run path meet at exactly one place: Recovery's `replan`. That crossing lands *here*. Consequence: **Planner is the one L3 component that sits on the run path**, and its availability affects whether the `replan` recovery strategy can fire at all.

**CALL TYPE** — sync from Problem Understanding; sync from Recovery during a run's recovery cycle.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Problem Understanding for build/modify intents; invoked by Recovery Policy Engine when Classify selects `replan`.
*Driver test:* both callers reach it — a fresh build produces a task skeleton, and a real failing run triggering `replan` also produces one.

**FAILURE TARGET** — on the design path, surfaces to the user. On the run path, a Planner failure during replan means Recovery cannot repair at that layer and must escalate.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Design work stops; **and the `replan` recovery strategy becomes unavailable**, degrading self-heal without stopping runs that do not need it.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. A partial or low-confidence decomposition must route to **8. Clarification Loop**, not proceed.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (ADVANCED-tier model calls — among the most expensive in the engine), Type/Schema Contracts, Eval & Red-team (planner changes must be evaluable before promotion, per design log Section 3).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not decide topology** — whether the solution needs one agent or five, manager-worker or parallel branches, is **10. Architecture Synthesizer**'s decision (Rule 5).
- Must not select models, tools, or agents (Rules 7–9).
- Must not compile anything into an executable graph — that is **14. Graph Compiler** (Rule 6).

**DONE GATE**
1. A real ProblemSpec produces a coherent task skeleton, verified against actual objectives rather than fixtures.
2. Ambiguity is flagged and routed to clarification rather than resolved by assumption.
3. **Both callers work** — the replan path from Recovery produces a valid skeleton, not only the fresh-build path. *(The old build's `recompile` and `replan` collapsed into one mechanism because only one path was truly wired.)*
4. Output contains no provider, model, or agent selections — boundary compliance is directly asserted.

---

### 8. Clarification Loop

*Asks the user a question when uncertainty genuinely blocks safe or useful progress — and only then.*

**INPUT** — an ambiguity signal from **3. Conversation Manager** (unclear intent), **6. Problem Understanding** (missing ProblemSpec field, including absent success criteria), **7. Planner** (undecidable decomposition), or **30. Recovery Policy Engine** (the `ask_user` strategy, and the ambiguous-outcome Classify bucket from design log Section 4).

**OUTPUT** — the user's answer, merged back into whichever component asked.

**Four callers across both paths** — the widest caller set of any L3 component, and the reason it cannot live inside any one of them.

**CALL TYPE** — async by nature. It suspends the asking component's progress and waits on a human, who may not be present.

**DRIVER** — invoked by its four callers. Delivery of the question to a human goes through **45. Notification**.
*Driver test:* a question raised during an unattended run actually reaches a person, rather than sitting unseen.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none directly; it *is* an escape hatch other components route to.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Without it, ambiguity cannot be resolved, so affected work stalls rather than proceeding wrongly.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. If a question cannot be delivered, the work waits — it must never proceed on an assumed answer.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (questions and answers are decision evidence), Type/Schema Contracts, Cost Ledger (STANDARD-tier model calls to phrase questions), Safety & Policy.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not ask when uncertainty does not materially block progress.** The original spec was explicit: ask only when it genuinely matters. An over-asking clarification loop destroys the product's core promise that the user need not become a workflow engineer.
- Must not answer on the user's behalf, ever, under any timeout.
- Must not decide anything itself — it relays a question and returns an answer.

**DONE GATE**
1. All four callers can raise a question and receive a merged answer.
2. A material ambiguity asks; an immaterial one does not — tested with real examples of each.
3. A question raised during an unattended run is delivered via Notification and the run resumes correctly on answer.
4. No timeout path auto-answers. Waiting indefinitely is correct behavior here.

---

### 9. Capability Resolver

*Determines what capability each task node requires — expressed as capability tags and a model tier, never as a provider or a specific implementation.*

**INPUT** — a task skeleton from **7. Planner**.

**OUTPUT** — per-node capability requirements: `{capability tags, model tier, tool class needed}` → to **10. Architecture Synthesizer**.

**Boundary precision (Rules 7–9, three genuinely separate concepts):** this component determines *what is required*. **11. Capability Registry** describes *what exists*. **12. Selection & Binding** picks *which concrete implementation*. Collapsing any two of these is the most likely architectural error in the entire engine.

**Deliberately does not query the Registry.** The old build's resolver documented this correctly ("performs no agent, embedding, performance, or database lookup") and that alignment is right — requirements are stated independently of what happens to be available. What the old build got *wrong* was the quality of the reasoning: tier inference was two hardcoded English keyword lists checked in fixed order, so ADVANCED won every tie. **The fix is better inference, not registry access** — a subtle distinction that is easy to get backwards.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Planner after decomposition.
*Driver test:* a real task skeleton produces per-node requirements that reach the Synthesizer.

**FAILURE TARGET** — design path; surfaces to the user.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Design path only.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An unresolvable requirement must surface, not default to a guessed tier.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (STANDARD-tier calls), Type/Schema Contracts, Eval & Red-team.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not name a provider, model, or agent — output is capability-level only (Rule 7).
- Must not query **11. Capability Registry** — requirements are independent of availability.
- Must not decide topology (Rule 5).

**DONE GATE**
1. Tier inference is principled and **not keyword-matched** — verified against real varied task descriptions, including ones that defeat keyword heuristics. *(This is the old build's open Medium finding, fixed by design here.)*
2. Output contains zero provider-specific or implementation-specific content.
3. Ties and edge cases resolve by stated reasoning rather than by evaluation order.

---

### 10. Architecture Synthesizer

*Decides what system should exist to solve this problem. **The moat.***

**INPUT** — task skeleton from **7. Planner** plus per-node capability requirements from **9. Capability Resolver**.

**OUTPUT** — an `ArchitectureSpec`: `{topology, agent roles, deterministic nodes, required tools, required data, subgraphs, branches, loops, human approval gates, parallelism, communication structure, termination conditions}` → to **11. Capability Registry** and **12. Selection & Binding**.

**This is the component the entire product thesis rests on** (design log Section 1). n8n, LangChain, and LangGraph all require a human to draw the graph; this decides what the graph should be. Everything else in the engine is infrastructure around this decision.

**It also places the human approval gates** from design log Section 16 — *where* an approval belongs is a topology decision made here; *which of the four modes* it runs in is configured later by the user.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Capability Resolver in the design chain.
*Driver test:* a real ProblemSpec traverses Planner → Resolver → Synthesizer and produces a complete ArchitectureSpec.

**FAILURE TARGET** — design path; surfaces to the user. Low confidence routes to **8. Clarification Loop**.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Design path only; existing workflows are unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. A low-confidence architecture must ask rather than ship a guessed topology — a wrong topology produces a workflow that runs successfully while doing the wrong thing, which verification may not catch.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (ADVANCED tier), Type/Schema Contracts (ArchitectureSpec is a core contract), Eval & Red-team (architecture generation changes must be evaluable before promotion), Policy Store (design log Section 3: learned architecture-pattern preferences inform this).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not compile the architecture into an executable DAG — that is **14. Graph Compiler** (Rule 6). The old build had a second compile path that bypassed this component entirely; that must not recur.
- Must not select concrete agents, models, or tools — it specifies *roles and requirements*; **12. Selection & Binding** picks implementations (Rule 9).
- Must not re-derive the problem statement — that is settled in the ProblemSpec.

**DONE GATE**
1. Real problems of different shapes produce genuinely different topologies — a single-agent problem does not receive a five-agent architecture, and vice versa.
2. Human approval gates are placed where a human genuinely should intervene, verified against real scenarios.
3. Output contains roles and requirements, never concrete provider or agent selections.
4. Low-confidence architecture triggers clarification rather than shipping.
5. **Every path to a compiled workflow passes through this component** — asserted structurally, so no bypass route can exist. *(Directly targets the old build's dual-compile-path defect.)*

---

## L4 — Capability Fabric

*All three components here are called by **30. Recovery Policy Engine** on the run path (swap-agent, rebind, create-new), not only by the design chain. L4 is dual-path, which raises its blast radius above a design-only layer.*

### 11. Capability Registry

*Describes what exists and can be used — the single searchable source of truth for every capability the engine can reach (Rule 8).*

**INPUT** — capability requirements from **10. Architecture Synthesizer**; registration writes from **13. Agent Factory** (new agents) and from system-level provisioning of tools, models, and templates.

**OUTPUT** — matching capability candidates with metadata → to **12. Selection & Binding**.

**Holds:** agents (the per-tenant agent library, design log Section 2), tools, models, MCP servers, REST APIs, SaaS connectors, databases, data sources, RAG systems, templates, workflow patterns, reusable subgraphs. Per-entry metadata: schema, permissions, tenant availability, auth requirements, cost, latency, quality, historical reliability, supported actions, risk, compatibility, **current availability**.

**Two ownership classes, different scoping rules — a distinction worth encoding explicitly:**
- **Tenant-owned entries** — agents created for a specific tenant. Strictly isolated per design log Section 2; a global view exists for internal/dev use only, never exposed to tenants.
- **System-owned entries** — models, built-in tools, and the hand-authored templates from Section 19. Shared across all tenants by design, because they contain no customer content.

Conflating these two classes is how a tenant's agent would leak into another tenant's candidate set.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for lookups; async for registration writes.

**DRIVER** — lookups driven by Selection & Binding and by Recovery. **Availability and health metadata need their own driver** — a real scheduled refresh, not a manual switch.
*Driver test:* a provider going unhealthy is reflected in registry availability without human intervention. *(The old build had a correct, properly-authorized provider-health failover switch that no automated signal ever fed — Pattern 3 exactly.)*

**FAILURE TARGET** — run path: a lookup failure during recovery means Recovery cannot swap or rebind and must escalate. Design path: surfaces to the user.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Compiled workflows keep running (bindings are already baked into the DAG), but new design work stops **and** the swap-agent / rebind recovery strategies become unavailable.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An incomplete candidate set must be reported as incomplete, never returned as if it were the full set — otherwise Selection & Binding silently picks from a truncated field.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts, Cost Ledger (embedding calls for capability matching), Safety & Policy.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not choose anything — it describes what exists; **12. Selection & Binding** chooses (Rules 8–9).
- Must not determine requirements — that is **9. Capability Resolver** (Rule 7).
- Must not author new capabilities — that is **13. Agent Factory**.

**DONE GATE**
1. A tenant's agents are never returned as candidates for a different tenant — tested with two real tenants holding similar agents.
2. System-owned entries (models, built-in tools, templates) are available to all tenants; tenant-owned entries are not.
3. **Availability metadata updates automatically** when a provider degrades — the driver-exists test.
4. An incomplete lookup reports incompleteness rather than returning a partial set silently.
5. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention** — tenant erasure removes their agents.

---

### 12. Selection & Binding

*Chooses the concrete implementation for each requirement — which agent, which model, which tool (Rule 9).*

**INPUT** — `ArchitectureSpec` from **10. Architecture Synthesizer**, candidates from **11. Capability Registry**, routing policy from **33. Policy Store**. On the run path, a rebind or swap request from **30. Recovery Policy Engine**.

**OUTPUT** — pinned binding decisions → to **14. Graph Compiler**. When no candidate fits, a creation request → to **13. Agent Factory**.

**Scoring must consider more than similarity.** The old build's entire routing formula was `similarity_weight × capability_similarity + performance_weight × performance_score` — two factors where the architecture named nine. Genuinely absent: latency, cost, availability, policy, risk. This contract requires the full factor set, with each factor's contribution inspectable.

**Policy outage must fail closed and loud.** The old build's policy client failed *open silently*: a policy-service outage reverted every tenant to a hardcoded default weight with no log line, so the system ran blind while appearing healthy. Design log's standing rule — judgment components fail closed and loud, never open and silent — applies here specifically.

**Also runs in critique mode.** Design log Section 8: when a user manually overrides a node's internals, the materiality pushback is produced by *this same scoring*, run as a comparison rather than a selection. Not new machinery — a second mode of the existing one.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Architecture Synthesizer on the design path; by Recovery on the run path; by **51. Canvas** (through Platform API) for critique-mode comparisons on manual override.
*Driver test:* all three callers work — a fresh design binds, a recovery swap rebinds, and a manual override produces a real comparison.

**FAILURE TARGET** — run path: escalates to Recovery. Design path: surfaces to the user.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Same reasoning as Registry: running workflows continue on existing bindings; new design and rebind-class recovery stop.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed and loud. On policy unavailability, refuse or flag degraded — never silently substitute defaults.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (cost is a scoring input *and* embeddings cost money), Policy Store, Type/Schema Contracts, Eval & Red-team, Audit (binding decisions are evidence).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not determine requirements (Rule 7) or decide topology (Rule 5).
- Must not author a new agent itself — it requests one from **13. Agent Factory** (design log Section 22's separation).
- Must not silently proceed on missing policy.

**DONE GATE**
1. Scoring demonstrably uses the full factor set — a cheap-and-fast candidate wins where appropriate, and a high-quality expensive one wins where that is warranted.
2. **Policy-store outage produces a loud, visible degraded state** — not a silent revert to defaults. *(Direct fix for a real old-build defect.)*
3. Critique mode produces an accurate comparison for a manual override, matching what Section 8 requires.
4. When nothing fits, Agent Factory is invoked rather than a poor-fit candidate being forced.
5. Each factor's contribution to a decision is inspectable after the fact.

---

### 13. Agent Factory

*Authors a new agent when no existing one fits — defining its role, instructions, model tier, and tool access.*

**One of only two genuinely unproven pieces in the product** (design log Section 1). Nobody in the industry has shipped live mid-run agent creation working; the old build's equivalent recovery strategy was honestly stubbed as *"no real target system wired yet."* Treat this component as R&D, not as routine implementation.

**INPUT** — a creation request carrying the unmet requirement: from **12. Selection & Binding** (design path, nothing fit) or **30. Recovery Policy Engine** (run path, self-heal per design log Section 4).

**OUTPUT** — a new agent definition `{role, instructions, model tier, tool bindings, constraints}` → registered into **11. Capability Registry** under the requesting tenant, and returned to the caller for immediate binding.

**Two callers in two different paths — this is why it is a separate component** (design log Section 22). A capability invoked by both Selection & Binding and Recovery cannot live inside either without the other reaching sideways through it.

**CALL TYPE** — sync. The caller is blocked; on the run path a workflow is mid-failure and waiting.

**DRIVER** — invoked by its two callers.
*Driver test:* both paths produce a usable agent — a design-time gap fills, and a live self-heal creates and binds one mid-run.

**FAILURE TARGET** — run path: escalates to Recovery, which must then degrade or terminate. Design path: routes to **8. Clarification Loop** to ask the user what is actually needed.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Existing workflows run; new agent creation and create-new self-heal are unavailable.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An agent that cannot be authored with confidence must not be created and bound — a bad agent silently inserted mid-run is worse than a failed run, because it produces plausible wrong output that verification may pass.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (ADVANCED tier), Safety & Policy (a generated agent's instructions are model-authored content and must be screened), Audit (creation events are exactly what design log Section 4 requires notifying the user about), Eval & Red-team, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not select among existing agents — that is **12. Selection & Binding** (it is called only *after* selection finds nothing).
- Must not decide topology or requirements (Rules 5, 7).
- Must not bypass verification for the agent it creates — a newly authored agent's output is verified exactly as strictly as any other, and arguably more so since it has no track record (design log Section 8's principle applied here).

**DONE GATE**
1. A design-time gap produces a usable agent that then performs its task correctly against real execution.
2. **A live run mid-failure creates, binds, and resumes with a new agent** — the genuinely hard case, tested for real rather than simulated.
3. The user is notified after the fact with what was created and why (design log Section 4).
4. A created agent's output passes through the same verification as any other node — no exemption.
5. Low-confidence authoring refuses rather than producing a plausible-looking bad agent.

---

## L5 — Graph Build

### 14. Graph Compiler

*Compiles an approved ArchitectureSpec plus pinned bindings into a typed, versioned, executable WorkflowDAG. It compiles; it does not design (Rule 6).*

**INPUT** — `ArchitectureSpec` from **10. Architecture Synthesizer** plus pinned binding decisions from **12. Selection & Binding**. On the run path, a recompile request from **30. Recovery Policy Engine**. From **51. Canvas** via Platform API, a validation request for a manual edit.

**OUTPUT** — a versioned `WorkflowDAG` → to **15. Workflow Lifecycle** and, at run time, to **16. Run Manager**.

**Exactly one compile path — enforced structurally.** The old build had two: a strict path consuming approved architecture and pinned bindings (correct), and a legacy path taking a raw task skeleton and compiling directly, bypassing Architecture Synthesizer, Capability Registry, and Selection & Binding entirely. The legacy path was not dead code — Recovery called it for `replan` and `recompile`. That is how the moat component gets bypassed in production while appearing present on the diagram. **Recovery's recompile and replan must enter through the same single path as everything else.**

**Branch-level recompile must be genuinely narrower than full replan.** Design log Section 4 keeps `recompile` and `replan` as distinct strategies with different granularity. In the old build they collapsed into one mechanism, for a specific structural reason: the legacy compile entry point required a *complete task skeleton*, and only the Planner produced one — so there was no way to recompile a branch without replanning everything. This compiler must accept an ArchitectureSpec **delta** and recompile the affected subgraph, or the two strategies remain one strategy wearing two names.

**Preserve the validation the old build genuinely got right** — its audit rated this as a real strength, and it should be carried forward deliberately: unique node and wave keys; entry nodes exist; every edge endpoint references an existing node; every wave node exists and appears in exactly one wave; wave dependencies reference a different wave; real Kahn's-algorithm cycle detection that names the participating nodes in the error. Re-validated again when a DAG is claimed for execution, so a corrupted stored graph cannot silently run.

**Add explicit graph size caps** — node and edge limits. The old build had none; comparable systems (Step Functions) enforce hard quotas. Without a cap, a pathological architecture compiles into something that cannot be executed or reasoned about.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Selection & Binding on the design path; by Recovery for recompile/replan; by Canvas for manual-edit validation (design log Section 8's impact analysis reuses this validator rather than duplicating it).
*Driver test:* all three callers compile or validate through this one component, and no fourth path exists.

**FAILURE TARGET** — run path: escalates to Recovery. Design path: surfaces to the user.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Already-compiled workflows keep running; new compilation and recompile-class recovery stop.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An invalid DAG must never compile — a graph that fails validation cannot be stored or executed under any circumstance.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Type/Schema Contracts (WorkflowDAG is a core contract), Audit, Eval & Red-team.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not invent architecture.** It compiles what Architecture Synthesizer decided (Rule 6). If it ever accepts input that has not passed through the Synthesizer, that is the dual-path defect returning.
- Must not select bindings — it consumes pinned decisions from Selection & Binding.
- Must not manage versions or promotion — that is **15. Workflow Lifecycle**.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Exactly one compile entry point exists** — asserted structurally, verified by a check that fails the build if a second appears.
2. Recovery's `recompile` recompiles a branch *without* requiring a full replan — proving the two strategies are genuinely distinct.
3. Full validation suite passes: cycles detected with participating nodes named, orphans caught, wave integrity enforced, dangling edges rejected.
4. Re-validation on claim rejects a corrupted stored DAG before execution.
5. Graph size caps enforced, with a clear error rather than a compile that later fails at runtime.
6. Canvas manual-edit validation uses this same validator — no duplicate implementation.

---

### 15. Workflow Lifecycle

*Owns a workflow's states and transitions: Draft → Test → Evaluation → Publish → Canary → Production → Rollback.*

**Formerly "Deployment Controller," restructured deliberately.** In the original architecture every execution passed through deployment, implying ad-hoc runs required a deployment step. That was wrong: deployment is lifecycle management, not a mandatory stage of the request path. **This component sits off the run path** — a run does not consult it.

**INPUT** — a compiled `WorkflowDAG` from **14. Graph Compiler**; promotion and rollback requests from **48. Platform API/BFF**; evaluation verdicts from **40. Eval & Red-team**.

**OUTPUT** — versioned workflow state; the production-designated version that **16. Run Manager** resolves when a trigger fires.

**Must drive the promotion gate.** The old build's promotion gate was described in its own audit as the best-designed component in the repository — fail-closed, tamper-evident, `Decimal` thresholds, missing metrics treated as blocking — *with zero production callers.* It ran only when a human typed a command. **This component is that gate's driver.** No promotion to production may occur without passing it.

**Versioning matters for in-flight runs.** Each run executes against the DAG version snapshotted at launch (design log Section 24). Publishing a new version must not mutate runs already executing against the old one.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for transitions; side-channel for evaluation checks.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Platform API for user-initiated transitions; **automatic rollback needs its own driver** — a real monitor watching canary health, not a human noticing.
*Driver test:* a canary version showing regression is rolled back automatically, with no human intervention.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none on the run path. A failed transition surfaces to the user.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Runs continue on their current production versions; publishing, canary, and — importantly — **rollback** become unavailable, which is the genuinely uncomfortable part of this outage.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. A promotion that cannot be verified as passing does not promote. A rollback that cannot be confirmed reports failure loudly rather than silently leaving a bad version live.

**PLANE DEPS** — Eval & Red-team (promotion gating), Observability, Audit (every transition is evidence), Type/Schema Contracts, Cost Ledger (canary traffic costs money).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not sit on the run path.** A run resolves its version and executes; it never waits on lifecycle logic. This is the restructure's entire point.
- Must not compile — that is **14. Graph Compiler**.
- Must not decide *whether* a workflow is good — it enforces the gate; **40. Eval & Red-team** produces the verdict.

**DONE GATE**
1. **The promotion gate actually runs on every production promotion** — the driver-exists test, targeting the old build's most expensive Pattern 3 failure.
2. A canary showing regression rolls back automatically, unprompted.
3. Publishing a new version does not disturb runs already in flight against the previous version.
4. A promotion with a missing evaluation metric is blocked, not passed by default.
5. **Run-path independence proven:** with this component stopped, a triggered workflow still resolves its production version and executes.

---

## L6 — Durable Runtime

*The run path's core. Two of the old build's most damaging critical defects lived here: a durable queue that nothing ever drove, and a catch block that permanently dropped customer runs on any transient database error.*

### 16. Run Manager

*Owns run identity, state, deadlines, cancellation, scheduling, and dispatch. The decision point for "does this run start."*

**INPUT** — a canonical event from **2. Event & Trigger Gateway** (picked up independently, per that component's async handoff); a manual run request via **48. Platform API/BFF**; the production DAG version resolved from **15. Workflow Lifecycle**.

**OUTPUT** — an enqueued run → **17. Durable Run Queue**; a started workflow execution → **19. Durable Substrate**.

**Owns the pre-flight budget gate** (design log Section 22). Because it already owns "does this run start," the spend check belongs here rather than in a separate component adding a network hop on the hottest path.

> **Hard requirement:** the budget check must be **atomic** against the budget record, not read-then-decide. Section 4 identified a real race — two parallel runs both pass the check and together exceed the cap. A non-atomic check leaves that unhandled by construction.

**Two old-build critical defects this contract exists to prevent:**
1. **Dispatch had no driver.** `dispatchNextQueuedRun` was invoked from exactly one place — immediately after enqueueing. A repository-wide search for `@Cron`, `setInterval`, `SchedulerRegistry`, `node-cron` and `scheduleJob` across the whole service returned **zero matches**. Since claiming is priority-ordered, enqueueing run A and draining one entry does not guarantee A is drained; the displaced run only moved if another run was later launched *for the same tenant*. If it was the last launch, it never started. Retry-later and lease-expiry recovery were dead for the same reason.
2. **One transient error permanently dropped a run.** The dispatch path wrapped everything in a single try/catch whose handler unconditionally acknowledged — deleting the queue entry. The comment's reasoning held only for terminal startup failures, but the catch's scope was wider: a connection blip or statement timeout inside `getRun` deleted the row while the run stayed `pending`, with nothing pointing at it. Unrecoverable without manual database intervention.

**CALL TYPE** — async. Runs are queued, not executed inline.

**DRIVER** — event pickup and manual requests drive enqueue. **Dispatch requires its own real scheduler** — a background sweeper draining per active tenant on an interval, with a tenant-fairness policy above it.
*Driver test:* **a queued run is dispatched with no further launches happening anywhere in the system.** This single test would have caught the largest finding in the old build's audit.

**FAILURE TARGET** — a run that fails to start is marked failed with a terminal outcome recorded, since the Executor's own finalization will never fire for a workflow that never started.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, but severe: no new runs start. Runs already executing on the Durable Substrate continue; the design path is unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. A run that cannot be safely started is not started, and is recorded as failed rather than left silently pending.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Cost Ledger (the budget gate reads from it), Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not execute nodes — that is **21. Executor**.
- Must not implement durability itself — that is **19. Durable Substrate** (Rule 12: durable execution is infrastructure-backed, never custom retry logic).
- Must not decide recovery strategy — that is **30. Recovery Policy Engine**.

**DONE GATE**
1. **A queued run dispatches with nothing else happening** — the driver-exists test.
2. A transient database error during dispatch **does not** delete the queue entry; the lease expires and the run is reclaimed. *(Narrow the catch to the genuinely terminal failure type only.)*
3. Budget gate is atomic — two concurrent runs cannot both pass a check that only one should.
4. A run failing to start is recorded as failed, never left orphaned in `pending`.
5. Cancellation and deadline enforcement work against real running workflows.

---

### 17. Durable Run Queue

*Durable, leased, priority-ordered queue of runs awaiting dispatch.*

**INPUT** — enqueue requests from **16. Run Manager**.
**OUTPUT** — claimed run entries to **16. Run Manager**'s dispatcher.

**The old build's implementation was genuinely sound in isolation** and should be carried forward: single-statement leasing via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, lease tokens so a stale worker cannot acknowledge another's entry, idempotent enqueue via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, priority ordering, bounded retry-later. Its audit rated the mechanism correct. **What was missing was a driver and a ceiling, not correctness.**

**Missing ceiling — must be fixed here:** `attempts` was incremented on every claim and **read by nobody**. A run failing deterministically at startup was claimed, failed, retried, and repeated indefinitely — counter climbing, no cap, no dead-letter path, no operator signal.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for claim and acknowledge operations.

**DRIVER** — driven by Run Manager's sweeper (see contract 16). This component deliberately has no internal timer; that design is correct **provided a real caller drives it**, which is precisely what the old build lacked.

**FAILURE TARGET** — a claim failure returns to Run Manager; the lease expires and the entry becomes reclaimable.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, severe. No runs can be queued or dispatched.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never acknowledge an entry whose work was not confirmed complete or terminally failed.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not drive itself — it is a queue, not a scheduler. The driver lives in Run Manager, and must demonstrably exist.
- Must not decide whether a run should start (budget, permissions) — that is Run Manager's gate.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Maximum attempts enforced with a dead-letter path** — a deterministically-failing run stops retrying, transitions to `failed` with a terminal reason, and raises an operator signal.
2. Lease expiry actually reclaims work: a dispatcher killed mid-dispatch leaves work that is genuinely recovered, not merely recoverable in principle.
3. `retryLater` honors its delay — "retry in 30s" means 30 seconds, not "whenever an unrelated run launches."
4. Two workers cannot claim the same entry; lease tokens reject stale acknowledgment.

---

### 18. Execution Workers

*Horizontal execution capacity — claims work, runs it, scales out. Temporal workers plus the engine's queue consumers.*

**INPUT** — work claimed from **19. Durable Substrate** task queues, and messages from internal queues (cost events, canonical events).
**OUTPUT** — executed node work, delegated to **21. Executor**.

**At-least-once consumption must be uniform and correct.** The old build contained both a correct and an incorrect consumer, and the money-carrying one was incorrect. The canonical-event consumer did it properly: messages stay in flight, failures redeliver on visibility timeout, deletion happens only on genuinely terminal outcomes, with a carried dead-letter receive count. The cost-event consumer ran against a provider that **deleted on receipt before processing**, producing three defects: malformed events vanished silently (already deleted, never requeued or dead-lettered or even logged), the self-republish mitigation carried no attempt counter so a consistently-failing event looped forever, and a crash between consume and republish lost the message permanently. **Every consumer in this build uses the visibility-timeout pattern; no exceptions, no second implementation.**

**CALL TYPE** — async, continuous polling.

**DRIVER** — worker processes poll their task queues. *Driver test:* workers are running and claiming; a queue with pending work and no active worker is a detectable, alerting condition rather than a silent stall.

**FAILURE TARGET** — node failures route to **30. Recovery Policy Engine** via Executor.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, severe. In-flight work stops progressing, though durable state is preserved and resumes when workers return.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never delete a message before its work is terminal.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Cost Ledger, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not implement its own retry or durability semantics — that belongs to the Durable Substrate (Rule 12).
- Must not delete-on-receipt, in any consumer, for any reason.

**DONE GATE**
1. A malformed message is dead-lettered and logged — never silently dropped.
2. A consistently-failing message stops after a bounded attempt count and dead-letters, rather than looping forever.
3. A worker crash mid-processing redelivers the message; nothing is lost.
4. **All consumers use the same visibility-timeout port** — asserted structurally so a second, weaker pattern cannot appear.

---

### 19. Durable Substrate (Temporal — external managed service)

*Provides durable execution: state persistence, replay, crash recovery, retries, timers, pause and resume.*

**External dependency, not built here.** The old build's audit called delegating durable execution to Temporal *"the single most consequential architectural decision in the system, and it is correct"* — most teams at that stage build their own half-correct state machine and discover the hard parts in production. That decision carries forward unchanged.

**INPUT** — workflow start requests from **16. Run Manager**; activity completions from **18. Execution Workers**.
**OUTPUT** — durable workflow state, history, and timer fires.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for starts; async for the execution lifecycle.

**DRIVER** — external service, driven by its own workers.
*Driver test:* a run survives a process kill mid-execution and resumes correctly from durable state.

**FAILURE TARGET** — substrate unavailability escalates; no run-path recovery can function without it.

**BLAST RADIUS** — **whole-engine for the run path.** Genuinely: nothing executes, nothing recovers, nothing resumes. One of very few components warranting this rating.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never fabricate durable state or proceed as though a checkpoint was written.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability (its history feeds the run timeline and time-travel debugging).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Nothing here is hand-rolled.** No custom retry logic, no bespoke state machine, no home-grown replay (Rule 12).
- Must not hold business state — that is **22. Blackboard** and **24. Side-Effect Ledger**.

**DONE GATE**
1. A run survives a hard process kill and resumes from durable state with no lost work.
2. Long waits (a workflow paused days for approval) resume correctly.
3. Timers fire accurately after restarts.
4. Workflow versioning for in-flight runs behaves correctly — a run completes against the version it started on.

---

### 20. Node Type Registry

*Tells Executor how to run each kind of node. New node kind means a new registry entry, with Executor untouched (design log Section 14).*

**INPUT** — a node-kind lookup from **21. Executor**; registration of node types at system initialization.
**OUTPUT** — the execution contract for that node kind.

**Node kinds:** LLMTask (agent-powered), ToolCall (mechanical action), Gate/conditional branch, HumanApproval (design log Section 16's four modes), Merge (parallel branches rejoining), Synthesis, PubSub, GroupChat, SandboxExec.

**Gate decisions must actually be enforced.** The old build had a critical finding where conditional-edge and Gate decisions were not enforced in the Executor — the node type existed, the decision was computed, and execution proceeded regardless. A registry entry that describes behavior nothing enforces is the same defect class as machinery with no driver.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Executor per node dispatch.
*Driver test:* every registered node kind is reachable and correctly dispatched by a real workflow execution.

**FAILURE TARGET** — an unknown node kind is a terminal compile-time error, not a runtime surprise — Graph Compiler validates node kinds at compile time.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Executor cannot dispatch without it.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An unrecognized node kind must refuse to execute, never fall through to a default behavior.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not execute anything — it describes *how*; **21. Executor** does the running (design log Section 14's separation).
- Must not hold workflow state.

**DONE GATE**
1. Each node kind executes correctly in a real workflow — not a fixture.
2. **Gate and conditional-edge decisions are genuinely enforced** — a Gate evaluating false actually prevents the downstream branch from running.
3. Adding a new node kind requires no change to Executor — proven by adding one.
4. An unknown node kind is caught at compile time, not at run time.

---

### 21. Executor

*Walks the compiled DAG and runs it: dispatches each node, feeds results into shared context, hands every output to verification, and streams progress as it goes.*

**INPUT** — a claimed `WorkflowDAG` and run context from **18. Execution Workers**; node execution contracts from **20. Node Type Registry**; prior node outputs from **22. Blackboard**; fired-effect records from **24. Side-Effect Ledger**.

**OUTPUT** — dispatches to **26. Model Gateway**, **27. Tool Gateway**, **28. Sandbox**; node outputs to **22. Blackboard** and **29. Verification & Quality Gate**; failures to **30. Recovery Policy Engine**; live progress to **52. Run Monitor** via Platform API.

**Runs parallel waves**, respecting the wave structure the Graph Compiler validated.

**Must check the idempotency gate before any re-execution.** Design log Section 4: before a retry or self-heal re-runs a node, confirm from **24. Side-Effect Ledger** that the earlier attempt did not already cause a real irreversible effect. Without this check, Recovery retrying a partially-completed workflow re-sends the message or re-writes the row — the recovery system becomes the thing that breaks the run.

**Must enforce Gate decisions.** Carried from contract 20: the old build computed conditional-edge and Gate decisions and then proceeded regardless. A false Gate must genuinely prevent its downstream branch from executing.

**Streaming must be real.** The old build's live run streaming was a canned mock with no API-mode branch at all — the adapter fabricated deterministic events by pattern-matching the run ID string, while two real backends existed and were never called. Progress reporting here must come from actual execution state.

**CALL TYPE** — async, long-running, durably checkpointed through **19. Durable Substrate**.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Execution Workers when a run is claimed.
*Driver test:* a real triggered run executes end-to-end through this component, with each node dispatched, verified, and recorded.

**FAILURE TARGET** — every node failure goes to **30. Recovery Policy Engine** for classification. Executor does not decide recovery strategy itself.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, severe. No node execution occurs; durable state is preserved and resumes when Executor returns.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. A node whose outcome cannot be determined is never treated as successful, and execution does not advance past an unverified node.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability (every node execution is traced), Audit, Cost Ledger (per-node cost attribution), Type/Schema Contracts, Safety & Policy.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not know *how* each node kind works internally — that is **20. Node Type Registry** (design log Section 14).
- Must not decide recovery strategy — that is **30. Recovery Policy Engine** (design log Section 4).
- Must not implement its own durability or retry semantics (Rule 12).
- Must not judge its own output quality — that is **29. Verification & Quality Gate**.

**DONE GATE**
1. A real multi-node workflow executes end-to-end, with parallel waves genuinely running in parallel.
2. **Every node's output passes through verification before execution advances** — no node is skipped, including nodes the user configured manually (design log Section 8).
3. A false Gate prevents its downstream branch from executing.
4. **The idempotency gate is consulted before every re-execution** — a retry after a partial success does not re-fire the completed effect.
5. Streaming reflects genuine execution state — verified by comparing streamed events against actual run history.

---

### 22. Blackboard

*Typed, per-run shared context. Downstream nodes inherit prior outputs through here rather than by re-prompting.*

**INPUT** — node outputs from **21. Executor**.
**OUTPUT** — accumulated run context to **21. Executor** for downstream nodes.

**Deliberately bounded.** The original architecture warned explicitly: do not let this become unlimited long-term memory. It holds the *current run's* working context and nothing more. Long-term context is **5. ADS Store**; learned policy is **33. Policy Store**; fired external effects are **24. Side-Effect Ledger**.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — written and read by Executor during execution.
*Driver test:* a downstream node genuinely receives an upstream node's output through this component, with no re-prompting.

**FAILURE TARGET** — a Blackboard failure is a node failure, classified by Recovery.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Runs cannot share context between nodes.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never return partial or stale context as though complete — a node reasoning on incomplete inherited context produces confidently wrong output.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Type/Schema Contracts, Audit.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not persist beyond the run's lifetime.
- Must not hold fired-effect records (that is 24), long-term memory (5), or policy (33).

**DONE GATE**
1. Context inheritance works across nodes in a real multi-step run.
2. Run isolation holds — one run cannot read another's context, verified with concurrent runs.
3. Context is cleaned up at run completion, bounded as designed.
4. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

---

### 23. Provisioning

*Prepares runtime environments on demand — sandbox spin-up or reuse, environment preparation, dependency injection at bind time.*

**Deliberately scoped small in v1.** Design log Section 23 deferred Project Mode, which is what would have made this component large (code execution at scale, package management, build pipelines). It stays in the architecture so Project Mode remains a later addition rather than a rearchitecture, but it is not built out beyond what Workflow Mode needs.

**INPUT** — provisioning requests from **21. Executor** for nodes requiring an isolated runtime.
**OUTPUT** — a prepared environment handle to **28. Sandbox**.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Executor for sandbox-requiring nodes.
*Driver test:* a real sandbox-requiring node gets a working prepared environment.

**FAILURE TARGET** — node failure, classified by Recovery.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Only nodes requiring an isolated runtime are affected; the rest of the workflow proceeds.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never hand back a partially-prepared environment — a sandbox missing a dependency produces failures that look like code errors.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (sandbox compute is billable), Safety & Policy, Audit.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not execute code — that is **28. Sandbox**.
- Must not grow into Project Mode scope without that decision being explicitly revisited (design log Section 23).

**DONE GATE**
1. A sandbox-requiring node receives a working environment against real execution.
2. Session reuse works — a second node reuses a warm environment rather than paying cold-start cost.
3. Orphaned environments are cleaned up. *(The old build had a real defect here — orphaned sandbox cleanup was a shipped fix.)*
4. A partially-prepared environment is never returned as ready.

---

### 24. Side-Effect Ledger

*Records which external actions actually fired during a run, so retries and self-heal never repeat an irreversible effect.*

**Exists because of design log Section 4's idempotency gate.** Without it that gate has nothing to check, and Recovery retrying a partially-completed workflow duplicates completed work — writing the same row twice, sending the same message twice. The recovery mechanism becomes the failure.

**INPUT** — effect records reported at the boundary where the effect actually occurs: **27. Tool Gateway** and **28. Sandbox**, carrying run context.
**OUTPUT** — fired-effect history for a run, read by **21. Executor** before re-execution and by **30. Recovery Policy Engine** during classification.

**Two-phase recording, because a perfect record is impossible.** There is an unavoidable window: an external call succeeds and the process dies before the record is written. Mitigation is to record *intent* before the call and *confirmation* after. A run resuming to find recorded intent without confirmation knows the effect may or may not have fired — which is honest and actionable, rather than a silent assumption in either direction.

**CALL TYPE** — sync. Recording must complete before the effect is considered settled.

**DRIVER** — written by Tool Gateway and Sandbox at effect boundaries; read by Executor and Recovery.
*Driver test:* a real external action produces both an intent record and a confirmation record, and a retry consults them.

**FAILURE TARGET** — if the ledger is unavailable, effects must not be performed (see fail mode).

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Nodes performing external effects cannot safely run; pure-computation nodes are unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — **fail-closed, strictly.** If a fired effect cannot be recorded, the effect must not be performed. An unrecorded effect is invisible to the idempotency gate and will be duplicated on the next retry. Refusing to act is the safe failure here.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (these records are evidence of real external actions), Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not hold general run context — that is **22. Blackboard**. This holds only externally-visible effects.
- Must not decide whether to retry — it supplies facts; **30. Recovery Policy Engine** decides.

**DONE GATE**
1. **A retry after partial success does not duplicate the completed effect** — tested with a real two-step workflow failing on the second step.
2. Intent-without-confirmation is surfaced as ambiguous rather than assumed either way.
3. Ledger unavailability blocks effect-performing nodes rather than allowing unrecorded effects.
4. Records survive process crashes — durability verified by killing mid-run.
5. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

---

### 25. Approval Store

*Holds the durable decision record for HumanApproval nodes — who approved, when, under which mode, and the promotion history.*

**Engine owns the facts; Platform owns the view** (design log Section 22). The decision record is execution evidence feeding the audit chain and Section 16's promotion logic, so it lives in the engine. The human-facing "what is waiting on me" inbox that spans runs and workflows is **53. Approval Inbox**, a Platform-side read model built on top of this.

**INPUT** — a pending approval raised by **21. Executor** when it reaches a HumanApproval node; decisions submitted via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — approval state to **21. Executor** (proceed or not); the record to **53. Approval Inbox** for display; promotion signals per Section 16.

**Holds Section 16's four modes** per node: always-block, auto-approve, auto-reject-or-skip on timeout, and approve-once-always-allow. Also the promotion history that supports the suggest-then-human-confirms flow — Alter may notice a run of consistent approvals and *offer* promotion, but the switch is always the user's explicit action.

**Permission to approve is checked, not assumed** — approving is one of the ten toggles in design log Section 15, resolved by **1. Identity & Tenant Gateway** and backed by **42. Identity & Membership**.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for decisions; the *waiting* itself is handled durably by **19. Durable Substrate**, not by holding a connection open.

**DRIVER** — raised by Executor; decided by humans via Platform API; **timeout mode needs its own driver** — a real scheduler for auto-reject-on-timeout.
*Driver test:* a timeout-mode approval actually times out and resolves without anyone touching the system.

**FAILURE TARGET** — an unresolvable approval escalates; the run waits rather than proceeding.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Workflows containing approval nodes block at those nodes; others are unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never auto-approve because state could not be read. Never lose a decision that a human actually made.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (approvals are core evidence), Type/Schema Contracts, Notification (delivery of pending approvals via **45**).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not build the inbox view — that is **53. Approval Inbox** (design log Section 22's split).
- Must not decide who may approve — it enforces the permission resolved upstream.
- Must not silently promote a node to auto-approve — promotion is always explicit human action (Section 16).

**DONE GATE**
1. All four modes behave correctly against real runs.
2. **Timeout mode fires without human intervention** — the driver-exists test.
3. A decision made by a permitted member proceeds; one attempted by an unpermitted member is rejected and logged.
4. Promotion is offered, never applied silently.
5. A paused run resumes correctly on approval, including after a process restart.
6. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

## L7 — Execution Gateways

*The only doors to models, tools, and code execution (Rule 10). Nothing else in the engine may reach an external provider directly.*

### 26. Model Gateway

*The single path to every LLM provider. Routes, falls back, redacts, enforces limits, and attributes cost.*

**INPUT** — model invocation requests from **21. Executor** (run path) and from every reasoning component on the design path: **3. Conversation Manager**, **6. Problem Understanding**, **7. Planner**, **8. Clarification Loop**, **9. Capability Resolver**, **10. Architecture Synthesizer**, **12. Selection & Binding**, **13. Agent Factory**, **29. Verification & Quality Gate**, **30. Recovery Policy Engine**, **31. Synthesis**, **32. Memory & Learning**.

**OUTPUT** — model responses to the caller; cost events to **39. Cost Ledger**; performance outcomes to **34. Drift Detector**.

**Provider independence is a locked principle** (design log Section 3): Alter is never married to one model or vendor. Routing, tier escalation, and fallback all live here, so no other component holds provider knowledge. This is also what makes the Section 3 decision — use frontier models rather than train one — architecturally safe: swapping providers is a gateway change, not a rewrite.

**Vendor SDKs live only inside provider adapters behind this gateway.** No caller anywhere imports a vendor SDK directly.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by its many callers.
*Driver test:* a real model call succeeds through the gateway, with cost recorded and outcome reported to Drift Detector.

**FAILURE TARGET** — run path: node failure → **30. Recovery Policy Engine**, whose `escalate_model` and `switch_provider` strategies act *through* this gateway. Design path: surfaces to the caller.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, severe and unusually broad: it affects **both paths**. Reasoning components on the design path and AI nodes on the run path all stop; purely deterministic nodes continue.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never fabricate a response, never silently downgrade to a weaker model without that being a recorded routing decision (design log Section 12: cost never silently degrades quality).

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (PII redaction, prompt-injection screening — consumed as the shared library per Section 11), Cost Ledger (every call), Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts (schema enforcement on structured outputs), Policy Store (learned routing weights).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not choose *which* agent or capability is needed — that is **12. Selection & Binding**. This gateway routes an already-decided model tier to a concrete provider.
- Must not let any caller bypass it to reach a provider directly (Rule 10).
- Must not silently substitute a cheaper model to save cost.

**DONE GATE**
1. A real model call works end-to-end, with cost attributed to tenant, run, and node.
2. Provider failover works against a genuinely failing provider — not a simulated one.
3. PII redaction is applied before content leaves the engine, verified with real sensitive content.
4. **No component anywhere imports a vendor SDK outside a provider adapter** — enforced by an architecture-boundary check that fails the build.
5. Structured-output schema enforcement rejects malformed model responses rather than passing them downstream.

---

### 27. Tool Gateway

*The only door to external tools and business systems — REST, MCP, SaaS connectors, browser automation, databases, and search.*

**INPUT** — tool invocation requests from **21. Executor**; **read-back requests from 29. Verification & Quality Gate**; credentials from **47. Connection & Credential Management**; permission context from **1. Identity & Tenant Gateway**.

**OUTPUT** — tool results to the caller; **effect records to 24. Side-Effect Ledger**; cost events to **39. Cost Ledger**; audit entries for every branch.

**It serves two distinct jobs, and the second is easy to overlook.** Beyond performing actions, design log Section 5's *mechanical verification* reads back from external systems through this gateway — confirming the Slack message really exists, the sheet row was really written. **A Tool Gateway outage therefore breaks verification as well as execution**, which is why its fail mode matters more than it first appears.

**Absorbs browser and database operations from Sandbox** (design log Section 22's restructure). Code execution and external business actions have different security models and blast radii and must not share a component.

**The old build's honest state, worth carrying forward as a warning:** exactly one tool was actually wired (`search_web`); every other tool name threw a clearly-worded not-implemented error rather than pretending. Of six protocol categories, only search was real. What *was* genuinely built and should be preserved: permission binding with an explicit allow-check, per-tenant rate limiting, credential resolution and token minting with eviction, and audit logging on every branch — success, denied, and error alike. **The governance scaffolding was right; the protocol breadth was not.** Being incomplete loudly is the correct way to be incomplete.

**SSRF defense carries forward as-is** — the old build's DNS-pinned fetcher was rated ahead of most production systems: it resolves the hostname, validates the addresses, then forces the socket to that exact validated IP, closing the rebinding window. Redirects are manually handled and revalidated per hop, and the blocklist covers private ranges, CGNAT, link-local, IPv6 ULA, the cloud metadata endpoint, and the IPv4-mapped-IPv6 encoding trap.

**Response size limits are mandatory, not defaulted-off.** The old build's shared fetcher defaulted `maxResponseBytes` to effectively unlimited; Sandbox passed a real 1 MB bound, Tool Gateway passed nothing — so a tenant workflow pointed at a large or slow response buffered it entirely in heap until timeout, twice over, crashing the gateway. **The safe value must be the one you get for free.**

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Executor and by Verification.
*Driver test:* both callers work — a node performs a real external action, and verification reads that same action back independently.

**FAILURE TARGET** — node failure → **30. Recovery Policy Engine**. A credential failure classifies specifically as Section 4's credential-authorization-gap bucket, which hard-stops rather than self-healing.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, severe: tool-performing nodes fail **and** mechanical verification cannot run.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. No action without a recorded effect (contract 24). No action without resolved permission. No unbounded response reads.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (SSRF guard, injection defense — the shared library from Section 11), Audit (every invocation, on every branch), Cost Ledger, Observability, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not execute arbitrary code — that is **28. Sandbox** (the restructure's whole point).
- Must not store credentials — it resolves them from **47. Connection & Credential Management**.
- Must not silently mock an unimplemented tool. An unwired tool fails loudly with a clear message; it never returns a fabricated success. *(Design log Section 7, pattern 1 — unmarked mocks behind real interfaces.)*

**DONE GATE**
1. A real external action fires against a real service, with an effect record written before and confirmed after.
2. **Verification read-back works** — the same action is independently confirmed through this gateway.
3. SSRF defense blocks DNS rebinding, private ranges, and the cloud metadata endpoint — tested with real attack shapes.
4. Response size limits enforced by default, with no way to construct an unbounded fetcher.
5. An unimplemented tool fails with a clear error and is never silently mocked.
6. Rate limiting and permission checks are enforced per tenant, verified with real cross-tenant attempts.

---

### 28. Sandbox

*Isolated computation only — code execution, file operations, package installation, build, lint, test, render, artifact generation.*

**Scoped deliberately small in v1** (design log Section 23): Project Mode is deferred, which is what would have made this component large. It stays present so Project Mode remains a later addition rather than a rearchitecture.

**Has shed browser, database, search, and business-API ownership to 27. Tool Gateway** (the Section 22 restructure). Code execution and external business actions have genuinely different blast radii; the old build mixed them in one component.

**INPUT** — execution requests from **21. Executor**; prepared environments from **23. Provisioning**.
**OUTPUT** — execution results and artifacts to **21. Executor**; effect records to **24. Side-Effect Ledger** where a sandbox action has external consequences; cost events to **39. Cost Ledger**.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Executor for code-execution nodes.
*Driver test:* a real code-execution node runs and returns genuine results.

**FAILURE TARGET** — node failure → **30. Recovery Policy Engine**.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Only code-execution nodes are affected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never report execution success without genuine confirmation of the exit state.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (isolation boundaries, untrusted code), Cost Ledger (compute is billable), Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not own general external tools** — no search, no browser, no database, no business APIs. Those belong to **27. Tool Gateway** (Rule 11).
- Must not persist state between runs except through explicit artifact storage.
- Must not expand into Project Mode scope without that decision being explicitly revisited.

**DONE GATE**
1. Real code executes in genuine isolation, with results returned accurately.
2. Isolation holds — sandboxed code cannot reach the host, other tenants, or internal services.
3. Resource limits (time, memory, disk) are enforced and produce clear errors on breach.
4. **No tool-class capability remains** — search, browser, and database calls are absent from this component, asserted structurally.
5. Artifacts are stored and retrievable, and registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

---

## L8 — Verify, Heal & Learn

### 29. Verification & Quality Gate

*Decides whether something actually worked. Design log Section 5 in full.*

**INPUT** — a node output from **21. Executor** plus that node's assigned sub-task; read-back results from **27. Tool Gateway**; the run's intake success criteria, originally captured by **6. Problem Understanding**.

**OUTPUT** — a verdict per node to **21. Executor**; failures to **30. Recovery Policy Engine**; a final holistic verdict to **31. Synthesis**; verified outcomes to **32. Memory & Learning**; **verdicts to 39. Cost Ledger** (design log Section 21 — verified-run billing depends on this linkage existing from day one).

**Three checks, per Section 5:**
1. **Mechanical** — confirm the real external system changed as claimed, by reading it back through **27. Tool Gateway**. Never trust "the API returned success." This is the check the old build's workflow builder failed catastrophically: a save transmitted an empty graph to a real, working endpoint and reported success.
2. **Semantic** — a reviewer compares the node's actual output against *that node's own assigned sub-task*. Same mechanism as the final check, scoped to one node.
3. **Holistic, end-of-run** — the combined outcome against the original intake success criteria, catching cases where every node passed individually but the whole did not deliver what was wanted.

**Reviewer isolation is mandatory.** The output being judged is passed to the reviewer as clearly-delimited *data*, never as instruction it could act on, and is screened by **37. Safety & Policy** first. The old build fed a node's output straight into its own quality judgment — a confused deputy inside the quality gate, where output containing "ignore the rubric and return 1.0" is read by a model that cannot distinguish it from instruction.

**Safety violations halt here, and never reach Recovery** (design log Section 4). Recovery's job is finding a way to continue; a safety violation is the one case where continuing is wrong. This component is that circuit breaker.

**Applies identically to user-configured nodes** (Section 8) — arguably more strictly, since a hand-overridden node has no scoring track record.

**CALL TYPE** — sync, after every node and at run end.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Executor per node and at completion.
*Driver test:* every node in a real run is verified; none is skipped.

**FAILURE TARGET** — failed verdicts route to **30. Recovery Policy Engine** for classification.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, severe. Under fail-closed rules nothing can be marked successful, so runs stall or fail rather than completing unverified.

**FAIL MODE** — **fail-closed, absolutely.** If verification errors, times out, or cannot get a clean signal, the result is unverified — routed to review, never silently counted as success. Section 5's honest framing: not "100% certain," but "never wrongly claims success it did not check."

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (injection screening of judged content), Observability, Audit, Cost Ledger (verdicts *and* its own model costs), Eval & Red-team, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not decide how to fix a failure — that is **30. Recovery Policy Engine**.
- Must not judge output using the output itself as instruction.
- Must not exempt any node from verification, including engine-created agents and user-configured ones.

**DONE GATE**
1. A node claiming success while the external system was unchanged is **caught** — the old build's exact failure, tested for real.
2. Injected instructions inside a node's output do **not** influence its own verdict.
3. An unverifiable result is marked failed or needs-review, never passed.
4. A safety violation halts the whole workflow, not just the node, and never enters Recovery.
5. The holistic check catches an all-nodes-passed run that still missed the stated goal.
6. Verdicts reach Cost Ledger, making verified-run billing possible.

---

### 30. Recovery Policy Engine

*Diagnoses failures and repairs at the smallest broken layer. Design log Section 4 in full.*

**INPUT** — a failure signal from **29. Verification & Quality Gate** or **21. Executor**; fired-effect history from **24. Side-Effect Ledger**; recovery preferences from **33. Policy Store**.

**OUTPUT** — a dispatched recovery action, and a notification to **45. Notification** describing what was done.

**Three internal stages, in strict order: Classify → Select Strategy → Dispatch.**

**Classify — five buckets:**
1. **Transient/environmental** (network blip, momentary rate limit, brief timeout) → one plain retry, no swap, no new agent.
2. **Node's-own-fault / deterministic** (broken logic, wrong tool bound) → instant self-heal via **12. Selection & Binding** (swap) or **13. Agent Factory** (create).
3. **Credential/authorization gap** → **hard stop, no self-heal.** Swapping an agent cannot fix an expired token. Notify the user with a clear explanation and what to do. Even with a standing auto-swap permission, this only ever applies between providers the user *already* connected — OAuth requires the human to authorize a new provider, and no setting bypasses that.
4. **Target resource/state mismatch** (channel deleted, sheet moved, permissions changed) → not fixable by retry, swap, or re-auth. Ask the user to redirect or recreate.
5. **Ambiguous outcome** (node ran cleanly, mechanical check passed, semantic reviewer cannot confidently judge) → routes **only** to **8. Clarification Loop**, never to retry or swap. Retrying an ambiguous-but-not-broken result reproduces the same ambiguity.

**Not handled here, deliberately:** policy/limit blocks are a *pre-flight* gate owned by **16. Run Manager** (only the parallel-run race residue reaches Classify); safety violations halt at **29. Verification** and never arrive.

**The idempotency gate sits in front of Dispatch, for every bucket leading to re-execution.** Before any retry or self-heal re-runs a node, confirm from **24. Side-Effect Ledger** that the prior attempt did not already fire an irreversible effect. Not a bucket — a shared check every dispatch passes through.

**Autonomous, notify-after** (Section 4): self-heal does not block mid-run for approval. The user is told what failed, what was created or swapped, and can retroactively request changes.

**The old build had no Classify stage at all** — a flat catch-all treated a transient database error as terminal and permanently dropped a real run that a plain retry would have fixed.

**CALL TYPE** — sync within the run's recovery cycle.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Verification and Executor on failure.
*Driver test:* a real failure of each classified type produces the correct strategy and a real repair.

**FAILURE TARGET** — itself terminal: if recovery cannot repair, the run degrades to partial results via **31. Synthesis** or terminates, with the user notified.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Failures cannot be repaired; runs fail rather than self-healing.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. An unclassifiable failure escalates to the user rather than defaulting to a guessed strategy.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (every recovery decision is evidence), Cost Ledger (recovery costs money and must be attributed), Policy Store, Eval & Red-team, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not handle safety violations — those halt at Verification.
- Must not run the pre-flight budget gate — that is Run Manager.
- Must not re-execute without consulting the idempotency gate.
- Must not block a run waiting for human approval of a self-heal (Section 4's explicit choice).

**DONE GATE**
1. Each of the five buckets classifies correctly against real failures of that type.
2. A transient error retries and succeeds; **it is never treated as terminal** — the old build's exact defect.
3. A credential gap hard-stops with a clear explanation rather than futile self-healing.
4. **The idempotency gate prevents a duplicate effect on retry** — verified with a real partially-completed workflow.
5. `recompile` repairs a branch without a full `replan` — the two strategies are genuinely distinct (contract 14).
6. The user is notified after every autonomous self-heal with what changed and why.
7. A deterministically-failing node stops after a bounded attempt count rather than looping.

---

### 31. Synthesis

*Assembles verified node outputs into the final deliverable — including honest partial results when Recovery calls for graceful degradation.*

**INPUT** — verified node outputs from **29. Verification & Quality Gate**; a degrade instruction from **30. Recovery Policy Engine**.
**OUTPUT** — the final run result to **21. Executor** and onward to the user; the outcome record to **32. Memory & Learning**.

**Partial results must be honestly labeled.** When Recovery degrades rather than terminates, the deliverable states what completed and what did not. A partial result presented as complete is the same class of defect as an unverified success.

**CALL TYPE** — sync, at run end.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Executor when the graph completes or is degraded.
*Driver test:* a completed run produces an assembled result; a degraded run produces a labeled partial one.

**FAILURE TARGET** — escalates to Recovery; a run whose results cannot be assembled is a failed run.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Runs execute but cannot deliver a final result.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never present partial output as complete.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Cost Ledger (ADVANCED-tier calls), Audit, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not verify — it assembles outputs already verified.
- Must not decide to degrade — that is Recovery's decision; Synthesis executes it honestly.

**DONE GATE**
1. A multi-node run produces a coherent assembled result.
2. A degraded run's output clearly states what did and did not complete.
3. Unverified output never reaches the deliverable.

---

### 32. Memory & Learning

*Turns verified outcomes into candidate learning — scoped, versioned, reversible, and provenanced.*

**INPUT** — verified run outcomes from **29. Verification & Quality Gate** and **31. Synthesis**.
**OUTPUT** — candidate policy updates to **33. Policy Store**; distilled context to **5. ADS Store**.

**Rule 13: verification happens before learning.** Only verified outcomes may produce learning. The old build **never checked the verdict before writing a candidate** — it read the verdict to *choose a scope* but did not reject failed or abandoned runs, so every run produced a stored candidate regardless of outcome.

**Provenance must be independently confirmed, not caller-asserted.** The old build accepted `verified_output_artifact_id` as a caller-supplied string, regex-shape-validated, and stored it as provenance without confirming that artifact actually passed verification. "Verified" was asserted at that boundary, never checked.

**Confidence scoring is required.** The old build had no confidence field anywhere in its request, response, or candidate models — learning was recorded without any measure of how much to trust it.

**Writes are candidates, not commits** — a two-phase, reversible structure with a real revocation mechanism. That part the old build got right and it carries forward.

**Feeds the cross-tenant abstracted layer** (design log Section 2): generalized lessons containing zero tenant-specific content may inform the global tier of **33. Policy Store**. Tenant-specific learning stays tenant-scoped.

**CALL TYPE** — async. Learning must never block a run's completion.

**DRIVER** — invoked on verified run completion.
*Driver test:* a verified run produces a learning candidate; **a failed run produces none.**

**FAILURE TARGET** — none. Learning failure must never fail a run.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Learning stops; runs are entirely unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed on writes. Never record learning whose provenance cannot be confirmed.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts, Eval & Red-team (learning that changes behavior must be evaluable before promotion), Cost Ledger.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not learn from unverified or failed outcomes (Rule 13).
- Must not rewrite engine behavior directly — it proposes policy updates only (Rule 14).
- Must not leak tenant-specific content into the global scope (Section 2).

**DONE GATE**
1. **A failed run produces no learning candidate** — the old build's exact defect.
2. Provenance is independently confirmed, not trusted from the caller.
3. Every candidate carries a confidence score.
4. Revocation genuinely reverses a recorded learning.
5. A global-scope candidate provably contains no tenant-specific content.

---

### 33. Policy Store

*Versioned, reversible store of learned policy — routing weights, quality thresholds, recovery preferences, architecture-pattern scores, agent and model performance.*

**INPUT** — candidate updates from **32. Memory & Learning**; decay signals from **34. Drift Detector**.
**OUTPUT** — active policy to **12. Selection & Binding**, **30. Recovery Policy Engine**, **10. Architecture Synthesizer**.

**Two scopes** (design log Section 22): **tenant-local** and **global**. The global tier — carrying Section 2's approved abstracted learning — must be **structurally incapable of holding tenant-specific content**, enforced by schema and by what the write path physically accepts, so a mistake fails loudly rather than silently leaking one customer's specifics into every tenant's policy.

**This is what "self-learning" actually updates** — not engine code (Rule 14). Versioned, inspectable, and rollback-able, which is exactly why design log Section 3 chose it over a neural approach.

**CALL TYPE** — sync for reads; async for candidate writes.

**DRIVER** — read by its consumers; written by Memory & Learning and Drift Detector.
*Driver test:* a policy change measurably alters a real routing decision, and rolling it back restores the prior behavior.

**FAILURE TARGET** — consumers fail closed and loud on unavailability (contract 12).

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Consumers must degrade visibly rather than silently reverting to defaults.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Optimistic-concurrency conflicts must be surfaced, never silently overwritten.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (policy changes are governance evidence), Type/Schema Contracts, Eval & Red-team (promotion gating).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not hold run state, long-term context, or fired-effect records.
- Must not accept a global-scope write containing tenant-identifiable content — structurally impossible, not merely discouraged.
- Must not apply an unevaluated policy change to production (Section 3).

**DONE GATE**
1. Versioning and rollback genuinely work — a bad policy is reversible and behavior returns to prior state.
2. A global write attempt carrying tenant-specific content **fails loudly**.
3. Concurrent updates conflict rather than silently overwriting.
4. A policy change is evaluable through Eval & Red-team before it can reach production.

---

### 34. Drift Detector

*Watches live performance over time — decays stale policy, and surfaces proactive improvement suggestions.*

**INPUT** — performance outcomes from **26. Model Gateway**, **27. Tool Gateway**, and run outcomes from **29. Verification & Quality Gate**.
**OUTPUT** — decay signals to **33. Policy Store**; **improvement suggestions to 45. Notification** for the user.

**Two output paths, and the second is new** (design log Section 17). The inward path decays stale policy scores. The **outward** path surfaces proactive improvement suggestions — a node consistently succeeding on a heavier tier than needed, two sequential nodes with no real dependency that could run in parallel, the same failure being auto-healed repeatedly where the design should change instead. **Alter suggests; the user decides.** It never silently edits a working workflow — a deliberate asymmetry against self-heal, which acts autonomously because something is already broken.

**Needs a real scheduler.** This is scheduled re-evaluation by nature. The old build's drift detector ran at one-third of its designed scope until a fix landed, and its provider-health failover switch was never fed by any automated signal at all.

**CALL TYPE** — side-channel, scheduled.

**DRIVER** — **a real scheduler, mandatory.**
*Driver test:* drift evaluation runs on schedule with no human involvement, and a genuine regression produces both a policy decay and a user-visible suggestion.

**FAILURE TARGET** — none; it is off the run path.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Policy quality slowly decays and suggestions stop; nothing immediate breaks.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-open with loud logging. It must never block runs — but silent failure means learning quietly rots, which is exactly how the old build's drift detector ran under-scoped unnoticed.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Eval & Red-team, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts, Cost Ledger.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must not apply changes to a working workflow** — it suggests only (Section 17).
- Must not decay policy on statistically insignificant deltas. *(The old build used a raw rate delta against a fixed threshold, with no significance testing.)*

**DONE GATE**
1. **Scheduled evaluation runs unprompted** — the driver-exists test.
2. A real performance regression produces a policy decay.
3. A genuine improvement opportunity surfaces as a suggestion the user can accept or ignore.
4. No suggestion is ever auto-applied.
5. Statistically insignificant variation does **not** trigger decay.

## Cross-Cutting Planes

*Called **during** execution, by any layer. Three are shared libraries or build-time packages rather than services; the template adapts where INPUT/OUTPUT does not naturally apply.*

### 35. Type/Schema Contracts

*Build-time shared package defining every typed object that crosses a component boundary. Not a runtime service.*

**Defines:** `ProblemSpec`, `ArchitectureSpec`, `WorkflowDAG`, `RunSpec`, `NodeInput`, `NodeOutput`, `VerificationResult`, `RecoveryDecision`, `LearningRecord`, `ActorContext`, canonical event shapes, and the capability metadata schema.

**Rule 17: every major control-flow object is typed and versioned.** Rule: critical control state never passes between components as unstructured natural-language strings.

**HOW IT IS CONSUMED** — imported at build time by every component. Changes require repo-owner approval; a breaking-change check gates CI.

**Single source of truth per primitive — non-negotiable.** The old build had **two independent ID validators with different strictness**: one enforcing strict UUIDv7, another accepting any version 1–7, with service-local copies following the looser form. Which validator a boundary happened to import decided what it accepted. It also shipped two packages that were literally `export {}` — empty stubs that CI linted, typechecked, and built on every run, one of them named `workflow-schema` for a workflow engine whose real schema lived elsewhere.

**BLAST RADIUS** — whole-engine, at build time. A contract error breaks compilation everywhere, which is the correct place for it to break.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed at build. A malformed or breaking contract change fails CI rather than reaching runtime.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not contain logic — definitions only.
- Must not permit a second definition of any shared primitive.
- Must not contain empty placeholder packages.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Exactly one validator exists per primitive** — asserted by a check that fails the build on a duplicate.
2. A breaking contract change fails CI before merge.
3. No empty stub packages exist in the build graph.
4. Every cross-component handoff named in these contracts has a corresponding typed definition.

---

### 36. Observability

*Shared library, dependency-injected into every component. Makes every run, node, decision, and cost traceable.*

**Traces:** run, workflow, node, agent, model, tool, retry, recovery, cost, latency, decision, approval.

**Rule 18: observability is part of the architecture, not an afterthought.** It feeds **52. Run Monitor**'s live view and the time-travel debugging that **19. Durable Substrate**'s history makes possible.

**HOW IT IS CONSUMED** — injected at composition root into every component; never optional, never conditionally wired.

**CALL TYPE** — side-channel. Never on the critical path; never blocking.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Visibility is lost, execution is not. **But treat a silent observability failure as serious** — an engine running blind is how the old build's defects survived so long undetected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-open, with loud local logging. Observability must never break a run, but its own failure must be visible.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not block execution.
- Must not carry PII into traces — screened by **37. Safety & Policy**.

**DONE GATE**
1. A real run produces a complete trace across every component it touched.
2. Cost, latency, and decisions are attributable per node.
3. An observability outage does not fail a run, and is itself alerted.
4. Traces contain no PII.

---

### 37. Safety & Policy

*Shared in-process library — SSRF guard, prompt-injection classification, PII redaction, upload rules, risk classification.*

**A library, not a service** (design log Section 11). Safety checks fire constantly — every tool call, every model call, every node output — so a network hop per check would add real latency to the hottest paths and create a new single point of failure. One package, imported and run in-process by **26. Model Gateway**, **27. Tool Gateway**, **28. Sandbox**, **29. Verification**, and **49. Public Surface**.

**Single source of truth, deliberately.** The old build reimplemented the same fetcher protection in two places and they drifted — Sandbox passed a 1 MB response bound, Tool Gateway passed none. One package eliminates that class of divergence.

**Carries forward the old build's genuinely strong work:** DNS-pinned SSRF defense (resolve, validate, force the socket to the validated IP, revalidate per redirect hop, block private ranges / CGNAT / link-local / IPv6 ULA / cloud metadata / the IPv4-mapped-IPv6 trap), and a real injection classifier making genuine calls rather than a mock loop.

**HOW IT IS CONSUMED** — imported directly; runs in the caller's process.

**CALL TYPE** — sync, in-process.

**BLAST RADIUS** — whole-engine, by design. If safety cannot be evaluated, unsafe operations must not proceed.

**FAIL MODE** — **fail-closed.** An unevaluable safety check blocks the operation. Never proceed on the assumption that content is safe.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not be bypassable by any caller, including internal ones.
- Must not be reimplemented anywhere — one package only.
- Must not silently downgrade a check it cannot perform.

**DONE GATE**
1. SSRF defense blocks DNS rebinding and metadata endpoints, tested with real attack shapes.
2. Injection classification catches real injection attempts, including those embedded in node outputs bound for **29. Verification**.
3. PII redaction runs before content leaves the engine.
4. **No duplicate implementation of any check exists** — asserted structurally.
5. Every consumer applies the same limits; no caller can construct an unbounded or unchecked variant.

---

### 38. Audit

*Standalone service. Tamper-evident, hash-chained record of what happened.*

**INPUT** — audit events from every component: authentication, binding decisions, tool invocations (success, denied, and error alike), approvals, recovery decisions, policy changes, deletions.
**OUTPUT** — queryable audit history; chain-verification results.

**The old build's chain design was genuinely strong** and carries forward: `prev_hash` and `entry_hash` each exactly 32 bytes, both uniquely indexed — the uniqueness on `prev_hash` specifically making it impossible to fork the chain by writing two entries claiming the same predecessor — plus a database trigger raising immutability on any update or delete. Its verifier detected all four real failure modes: fork, cycle, hash mismatch, and orphaned entries.

**And it never ran.** A repository-wide search for the verifier returned exactly one result: the method definition itself. Not routed on a controller, not scheduled, not invoked by CI. *"A hash chain that is written but never verified provides zero tamper detection — the compliance equivalent of installing a smoke alarm and never connecting the battery."* **This contract's central requirement is that the verifier has a real driver.**

**Survives account deletion in minimized form** (design log Section 18): event skeleton only, retained for a defined window, then genuinely destroyed.

**CALL TYPE** — async writes (never block execution); sync reads.

**DRIVER** — writes driven by every component. **Chain verification requires a scheduler**, with alerting on any non-valid result. The read path must be incremental before it can run on a schedule.
*Driver test:* chain verification runs on schedule, unprompted, and a deliberately tampered entry raises an alert.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only) for writes. **But an audit gap is a compliance gap**, so write failures must be loud.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-open for writes with loud alerting (never block a run), fail-closed for verification (never report a chain valid that was not checked).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not be mutable by any caller — append-only, enforced at the database.
- Must not be deletable by the subject it audits, except through the minimization path in Section 18.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Chain verification runs on a schedule** — the driver-exists test, targeting the old build's inert-control defect.
2. A tampered entry is detected and alerted.
3. All four failure modes (fork, cycle, hash mismatch, orphan) are caught.
4. Immutability holds against a direct update or delete attempt.
5. Account deletion minimizes rather than erases, per Section 18, and the retained skeleton is destroyed on schedule.

---

### 39. Cost Ledger

*Standalone service. Tracks what everything costs, attributed finely enough to bill on.*

**INPUT** — cost events from **26. Model Gateway**, **27. Tool Gateway**, **28. Sandbox**, **23. Provisioning**; **verification verdicts from 29. Verification & Quality Gate**.
**OUTPUT** — cost attribution and pre-run estimates to **16. Run Manager**'s budget gate; usage data to **43. Billing & Subscription**; cost as a scoring input to **12. Selection & Binding**.

**Attribution granularity:** tenant, workflow, run, node, model/provider, tool, sandbox compute, storage, and retries/recovery — separating internal cost from billable cost from margin.

**Must record verification verdicts from day one** (design log Section 21). Verified-run billing means credits are consumed only by runs that passed verification. If this linkage is missing early, adding billing later requires backfilling data that was never captured.

**Round once, at the end.** The old build rounded the *per-unit* price before multiplying by quantity — `Math.ceil` promoting any fraction to 1, then multiplying by the full token count. Estimates ran 2× to 100× over reality for exactly the resource that dominates spend in an LLM engine, and its own test encoded the wrong expectation as correct. Carry the unit price as a scaled integer and divide at the end; no float participates.

**Integer minor units in storage, and idempotency on charge records** — both things the old build got right, preserved.

**CALL TYPE** — async writes; sync reads for the budget gate and estimates.

**DRIVER** — writes driven by the gateways; estimates read by Run Manager.
*Driver test:* a real run produces complete cost attribution across every node, with its verification verdict recorded alongside.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. The budget gate fails closed without it (contract 16), so runs will not start rather than running unmetered.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed for the budget gate. An unknown spend position must block, not permit.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not decide what a customer pays — that is **43. Billing & Subscription**.
- Must not use floating point anywhere in the money path.
- Must not round before the final computation.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Estimates match actual cost within a tight margin** — verified against real model calls, directly targeting the old build's 2×–100× defect.
2. No float appears anywhere in the cost path, asserted structurally.
3. Verification verdicts are recorded against runs, making verified-run billing possible.
4. Attribution is complete across every dimension for a real multi-node run.
5. Duplicate cost events do not double-count.

---

### 40. Eval & Red-team

*Standalone service. Golden sets, adversarial suites, and the promotion gate that decides whether a change may reach production.*

**INPUT** — evaluation requests from **15. Workflow Lifecycle** (promotion), from CI, and from **32. Memory & Learning** / **33. Policy Store** (learning that changes behavior must be evaluable before promotion, per design log Section 3).
**OUTPUT** — evaluation verdicts and promotion decisions to **15. Workflow Lifecycle**.

**Fail-closed harness — the old build got this right and it carries forward verbatim in spirit:** a case the orchestrator cannot execute is scored **fail**, never silently skipped and never silently counted as pass. Every domain scorer fails on client exception, and an empty golden set yields a pass rate of 0.0 rather than 1.0. This was the single most important property to preserve, because a quality gate that can pass without verifying hides everything behind it.

**The promotion gate was the best-designed component in the old repository** — missing metrics treated as blocking rather than skipped, checks compared with strict identity so a truthy-but-wrong value fails, mandatory approvals and exact environment matching, `Decimal` thresholds never float, and the whole evidence object canonicalized and SHA-256 digested for tamper evidence. **Its only defect was that nothing called it.** Its driver is **15. Workflow Lifecycle** (contract 15).

**Red-team suites must actually be executable.** The old build seeded six red-team golden sets with an operation no scorer implemented — a repository-wide search for that operation found only the seed file itself. All six reported 0% pass permanently, for reasons unrelated to security, and the failure text was infrastructure-shaped so it read as noise. *A corpus that always fails carries exactly as much security information as one that always passes: none.*

**CALL TYPE** — sync for promotion gating; async for scheduled evaluation runs.

**DRIVER** — promotion gating driven by Workflow Lifecycle; **scheduled regression evaluation needs its own scheduler.**
*Driver test:* the promotion gate blocks a real promotion that should fail, and scheduled evaluation runs unprompted.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Promotion halts (correctly) rather than proceeding unevaluated.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed, absolutely. Unevaluable means fail, never pass.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not be bypassable for a production promotion.
- Must not contain a golden set that cannot actually execute.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Every red-team suite genuinely executes** and can both pass and fail — no permanently-failing corpus.
2. The promotion gate blocks a promotion with a missing metric.
3. An unexecutable case scores fail, not pass or skip.
4. An empty golden set yields 0.0, not 1.0.
5. Scheduled evaluation runs without human involvement.

---

### 41. Cache / Reuse — **DEFERRED**

*Semantic cache in front of Model Gateway, allowing repeat or near-identical work to reuse a prior verified result.*

**Deliberately deferred past v1** (design log Section 12). Needs real usage volume to be worth anything — there is nothing to reuse on day one — and it competes for effort against components that are load-bearing for the engine to function at all.

**Explicitly not a quality tradeoff.** A cached result is one that already passed the full verification pipeline; reusing it skips redundant recomputation, not verification. This is a different thing entirely from choosing a weaker model to save money, which is **12. Selection & Binding**'s territory and is never done silently (Section 12).

**When built, it must never violate:** tenant boundaries, permissions, freshness, or workflow correctness.

**No contract written until it is scheduled for build.** Recorded here so the architecture accounts for it and its absence is a decision rather than an oversight.

---

## Account / Control Plane

*Off the run path. Accounts, billing, deletion, notifications, workspace facts, and connections — none of these are consulted while a workflow executes, which is what distinguishes them from the cross-cutting planes.*

### 42. Identity & Membership

*Stores and manages who belongs to a tenant and what each member may do. Design log Section 15.*

**INPUT** — member invitations, role assignments, and custom role definitions via **48. Platform API/BFF**; identity assertions from the managed provider (Section 20).
**OUTPUT** — roles and resolved permissions to **1. Identity & Tenant Gateway**, which enforces them per request.

**The enforce/manage split matters:** contract 1 *enforces* permission on each request; this component *stores and manages* the underlying facts. The old build's critical defect lived precisely in that gap — the gateway derived roles from real database queries and then set permissions to a literal empty array, because nothing anywhere derived a permission from a role.

**Owner is separate from any assignable role.** Owner-only actions — billing, transferring ownership, deleting the account — can never be granted through a role, including Admin. Owner is permanent to the tenant's creator or an explicit deliberate transfer.

**Ten permission toggles, bounded and closed** (Sections 15 and 18): create workflow · edit workflow · view workflow · approve at a HumanApproval node · review a self-heal replacement · manage tool credentials · set a workflow budget cap · invite/remove members and assign roles · view billing · change data retention settings.

**Roles are `{name, set of the 10 toggles}`** — predefined roles are shipped presets of that shape; a custom role is the owner naming their own combination. One data model, not two systems. **Custom roles are private per tenant** (Section 2's isolation applied here).

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Platform API for management operations; read by Identity & Tenant Gateway per request.
*Driver test:* a role change propagates to real request-time permission resolution.

**BLAST RADIUS** — whole-engine. Permission resolution fails closed without it, so nothing proceeds.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never grant a permission that cannot be confirmed.

**PLANE DEPS** — Audit (membership and role changes are governance evidence), Observability, Type/Schema Contracts, Safety & Policy.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not enforce permissions per request — that is **1. Identity & Tenant Gateway**.
- Must not permit an owner-only action to be granted through any role.
- Must not expose one tenant's custom roles to another.

**DONE GATE**
1. **A real member with a real role resolves to a non-empty permission set** — closing the old build's exact critical defect end-to-end.
2. Admin cannot perform an owner-only action.
3. A custom role is invisible to other tenants.
4. Removing a member immediately revokes their access, verified against a live session.
5. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

---

### 43. Billing & Subscription — **BUILD DEFERRED**

*What the customer pays: subscription state, credit balances, free-tier limits, charging. Design log Section 21.*

**Distinct from 39. Cost Ledger, deliberately.** Cost Ledger answers *what did this cost us* — internal, per-run engineering data. This answers *what does this customer owe, what is their balance, are they past the free tier, did their payment fail* — different data, different lifecycle, real financial-correctness stakes.

**Model:** hybrid — base subscription plus credits, plus a free tier. **Verified-run billing:** credits are consumed only by runs that pass verification. A run that fails verification, stalls, or never completes does not bill. This is only honestly claimable because of contract 29's rigor.

**⚠ Deferred, with one hook that is NOT deferred.** Credit pricing values and free-tier limits are the user's to define, and the component is built later. **But 39. Cost Ledger must record verification verdicts from day one** — without that linkage, adding billing later means backfilling data that was never captured.

**Also unresolved and to be settled in the same later pass:** free-tier abuse protection. A free tier that can trigger real model calls is a genuine abuse vector, and its guard should be designed alongside pricing rather than bolted on after.

**When built:** pricing values live as configuration, never hardcoded, so setting real numbers is a config change rather than a code change.

**No full contract until scheduled for build.**

---

### 44. Deletion & Retention

*Executes erasure and retention. Design log Sections 18 and 28 — the component answering the old build's worst defect.*

**INPUT** — deletion requests (member offboarding, member erasure request, account deletion) via **48. Platform API/BFF**; retention settings; the registration declarations of every component holding tenant data.
**OUTPUT** — erasure execution across all registered components; a certification that is either genuinely complete or explicitly incomplete.

**The old build's failure, stated precisely:** deletion worked from two hardcoded 19-entry lists while the schema defined 29 tables. Ten of them carried tenant data — phone numbers, webhook secrets, artifacts, projects, escalations, queued work. The verifier then iterated **the same incomplete list**, found nothing remaining, and certified the deletion verified and complete. *The verification was self-referential: it confirmed what it deleted, never what existed.* A regulator would have been told the data was gone. Every missing table came from a later migration — the list was correct when written and quietly went stale.

**Three structural requirements (Section 28), enforced not merely intended:**
1. **Declaration** — every component holding tenant data declares what it holds and how to erase it. All contracts above carrying tenant data name this registration in their done gate.
2. **Fail-closed certification** — refuse to certify completeness if any component holding tenant data has not registered.
3. **CI enforcement** — the build fails when a component stores tenant data without a registration. *This is the load-bearing one: care already failed once, so only an automated check prevents recurrence.*

**Verification checks what exists, never what was deleted.** Enumerate live schema; fail loudly on anything not explicitly marked in-scope or exempt.

**Three distinct events** (Section 18): *member offboarded* — audit records survive, attributed, as the organization's records. *Member demands personal erasure* — strip personally identifying details, keep the record under a stable pseudonymous identifier so the who-did-what chain stays verifiable. *Account deleted* — everything user-facing destroyed immediately; audit minimized to an event skeleton, retained for a defined window, then genuinely destroyed.

**Run history expiry** (Section 18): user-configurable within bounds (roughly 7 days to 1 year). **Lowering the window is a destructive action** — explicit confirmation naming what will be destroyed, and gated behind the tenth permission toggle.

**CALL TYPE** — async for execution; sync for certification queries.

**DRIVER** — deletion requests drive erasure. **Retention expiry needs its own scheduler.**
*Driver test:* run history past the configured window is deleted automatically, unprompted.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only) operationally, but **a deletion gap is a compliance failure**, so it must be loud.

**FAIL MODE** — **fail-closed, absolutely.** If erasure cannot be confirmed complete, report incomplete. Never certify what was not verified.

**PLANE DEPS** — Audit (deletions are evidence; the deletion ledger is itself append-only), Observability, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not work from a hand-maintained list, ever.
- Must not verify against its own deletion list.
- Must not certify completeness it did not establish.

**DONE GATE**
1. **A tenant table added without registration fails the build** — the CI enforcement test.
2. Erasure covers every registered component, verified by checking what *exists* afterward.
3. An unregistered component blocks certification rather than being silently skipped.
4. Retention expiry runs on schedule, unprompted.
5. Lowering a retention window states exactly what will be destroyed and requires the correct permission.
6. Owner account deletion minimizes audit correctly and destroys the skeleton on schedule.

---

### 45. Notification

*Delivers what the engine needs a human to know. Design log Sections 4, 16, 17.*

**Exists because three separate locked decisions all assumed a delivery mechanism nobody owned** — exactly the old build's Pattern 3 shape, caught before code this time.

**INPUT** — self-heal notifications from **30. Recovery Policy Engine** (Section 4: autonomous repair, notify after); pending approvals from **25. Approval Store** (Section 16); proactive improvement suggestions from **34. Drift Detector** (Section 17); questions from **8. Clarification Loop**; budget threshold alerts from **39. Cost Ledger** (Section 9).

**OUTPUT** — delivered notifications to the user, through channels still to be decided.

**⚠ Open item carried from design log Section 16:** the actual delivery channels — push, email, in-app badge, or some combination — are not yet decided. This does not block the architecture but must be settled before the approval flow is built end-to-end, since an approval nobody sees is functionally an approval that never fired.

**CALL TYPE** — async. Never blocks a run.

**DRIVER** — invoked by its five senders. **Retry of undelivered notifications needs its own driver.**
*Driver test:* an approval raised during an unattended run genuinely reaches a person.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Runs continue, but **humans stop learning that they are needed** — pending approvals go unseen, self-heals unreviewed, suggestions unnoticed.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed on delivery confirmation. An undelivered notification must be retried and surfaced, never silently dropped — the failure mode that makes an approval gate meaningless.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts, Safety & Policy (notification content may include model-generated text).

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not decide *whether* something is worth notifying — senders decide; it delivers.
- Must not block execution on delivery.
- Must not silently drop an undeliverable notification.

**DONE GATE**
1. All five senders deliver successfully.
2. An approval raised during an unattended run reaches a real person.
3. Undelivered notifications are retried and surfaced, never lost.
4. A notification storm (many failures at once) is rate-limited without dropping distinct events.

---

### 46. Workspace & Workflow Management

*Owns the workflow-ownership and grouping facts. Design log Sections 10, 22, and renamed in Section 26.*

**Renamed from "Workspace & Session Management"** to eliminate the collision where "session" meant both an auth session and a chat session (Section 26).

**INPUT** — workflow creation and grouping operations via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — workflow ownership and grouping facts to **4. ADS Client** (defining its retrieval boundary) and **1. Identity & Tenant Gateway** (resolving tenant for trigger-originated runs).

**Engine owns the facts, Platform owns presentation** (Section 22). The facts live here because Section 10's cross-workflow context makes workflow membership a **retrieval boundary the engine actually reads** — not display metadata. If it lived Platform-side, the engine would have to read Platform storage to answer "what else has this user built," inverting the dependency direction. Sidebar rendering, folder display names, ordering, and search UI belong to **54. Account & Admin** and **50. Chat & Workflow Builder**.

**One workflow equals one chat session** (Section 10). Sessions group into named folders plus an Ungrouped bucket.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by Platform API; read by ADS Client and Identity & Tenant Gateway.
*Driver test:* a new workflow is correctly scoped for retrieval, and a trigger-originated run resolves its tenant through these facts.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. New workflow creation and retrieval scoping stop; existing compiled workflows still run.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never return an unscoped or ambiguous ownership answer.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not hold conversation content — that is **3. Conversation Manager** (live) and **5. ADS Store** (long-term).
- Must not own presentation concerns.

**DONE GATE**
1. Workflow ownership resolves correctly for both human and trigger-originated paths.
2. ADS retrieval scoping matches grouping facts, including the cross-workflow broadening case.
3. Cross-tenant workflow access is impossible.
4. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

---

### 47. Connection & Credential Management

*Where a user connects, re-authorizes, and revokes the external accounts their workflows use.*

**INPUT** — OAuth flows and credential operations initiated by the user via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — resolvable credential references to **27. Tool Gateway**; connection status to **30. Recovery Policy Engine**'s credential-gap classification and to **10. Architecture Synthesizer**'s pre-compile capability check.

**Design log Section 8's batch-ask depends on this.** Alter requests all needed connectors **after Architecture Synthesizer determines the full workflow**, not one-by-one mid-conversation and not as a pre-connect-everything gate — because the full tool list is not known until the design is complete.

**Connections belong to the tenant, not the member who authorized them** (Section 15). A Slack connection authorized by one member is usable by any permitted member's workflows, and survives that member leaving.

**Secrets by reference only** — never values in code, config, logs, or traces. Tool Gateway resolves and mints tokens at call time; it does not store them.

**Section 4's credential-gap bucket hard-stops and points here.** When a token expires or is revoked mid-run, self-heal cannot fix it — the user must reconnect. And **no permission setting can authorize a brand-new provider**: OAuth requires the human to approve on the provider's own page, which is a technical constraint, not a policy choice.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — user-initiated flows. **Expiry monitoring needs its own driver** — a real check that warns before a token expires rather than discovering it mid-run.
*Driver test:* an approaching credential expiry produces a proactive notification, unprompted.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only. Tool-performing nodes fail on credential resolution; pure-computation nodes continue.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never proceed with an unresolvable or expired credential.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy, Audit (connection grants and revocations are evidence), Observability, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not perform tool calls — that is **27. Tool Gateway**.
- Must not expose secret values to any caller, including internal ones.
- Must not attempt to self-authorize a provider the user has not approved.

**DONE GATE**
1. A real OAuth connection completes and a workflow uses it end-to-end.
2. Secrets never appear in logs, traces, or error messages — asserted by scanning real output.
3. Revocation takes effect immediately; a running workflow's next call fails closed.
4. **Expiry warning fires before expiry**, unprompted — the driver-exists test.
5. A connection survives its authorizing member's removal from the tenant.
6. Registered with **44. Deletion & Retention**.

---

## Surfaces

*Everything users and external systems actually touch. Per design log Section 6, these are built as **thin verification surfaces first** — real endpoint, real data, minimal polish — appearing incrementally as the backend each one exercises becomes real. Polish comes after the full build. The guard is explicit: **UI must never get ahead of real backend wiring**, because that is precisely what produced the old build's fake canvas.*

### 48. Platform API / BFF

*The sole caller of the engine. Engine APIs stay private; every authenticated user action passes through here.*

**INPUT** — authenticated requests from surfaces **50–54**.
**OUTPUT** — calls into engine components; assembled read models back to the surfaces.

**One shared, configured connection pool — mandatory.** The old build constructed **29 separate unconfigured pools across 24 modules**, each `new Pool({ connectionString })` with no `max`, no `idleTimeoutMillis`, no `connectionTimeoutMillis`, no `statement_timeout`. At the default of 10 connections per pool that is 290 from a single instance against a PostgreSQL default of 100 — one instance capable of exhausting the entire cluster's budget nearly three times over, before a second replica connects. With no connection timeout, requests waiting on a saturated pool hang indefinitely rather than failing fast, so the symptom is creeping latency and a wedged API rather than clean errors. **This will not appear in testing; it appears the first time real concurrency arrives.**

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — invoked by the surfaces per user action.
*Driver test:* a real user action traverses surface → this component → engine → back.

**BLAST RADIUS** — whole-engine *for users*. No one can reach the product. Triggered runs continue unaffected, since they enter through **2. Event & Trigger Gateway**.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Safety & Policy, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not contain engine logic — it calls the engine, it does not reimplement it.
- Must not permit a surface to reach an engine component directly.
- Must not construct its own database pool.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Exactly one configured pool provider exists**, with explicit max, connection timeout, idle timeout, and statement timeout — asserted structurally so an inline construction fails the build.
2. Every endpoint carrying a permission requirement is reachable by a correctly-permitted real user *(the old build had 101 endpoints unreachable by everyone)*.
3. Under sustained concurrency the API degrades with clean errors rather than wedging.
4. No surface can bypass it to reach the engine.

### 49. Public Surface

*The only door anonymous, unauthenticated traffic touches. Hosted forms and public endpoints. Design log Section 25.*

**INPUT** — anonymous submissions and external posts from the public internet.
**OUTPUT** — normalized submissions forwarded to **2. Event & Trigger Gateway**.

**Separate from Platform Web deliberately** — that surface is authenticated, this one is the opposite by design: no login, anyone with the link, untrusted input by definition. Separate from Event & Trigger Gateway because serving a rendered page to a browser is different work from receiving and normalizing signals, and because **its blast radius must be contained**: if the public endpoint is flooded, that must degrade public submissions only, not the trigger system also serving scheduled and internal triggers.

**Primary consumer of 37. Safety & Policy** — untrusted input handling, injection defense, upload rules, rate limiting.

**CALL TYPE** — sync to the submitter (fast acknowledgment); async downstream, per contract 2's sign-and-release model.

**DRIVER** — external traffic.
*Driver test:* a real anonymous form submission reaches the engine and starts a run.

**BLAST RADIUS** — this-layer-only, deliberately contained. Public submissions stop; authenticated use and other trigger types continue.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Reject what cannot be validated. Never accept-and-hope.

**PLANE DEPS** — Safety & Policy (heaviest consumer), Observability, Audit, Cost Ledger (public traffic costs money and is an abuse vector), Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not expose authenticated functionality.
- Must not trust any input, ever.
- Must not share rate-limit budget with authenticated traffic.

**DONE GATE**
1. A real anonymous submission starts a real run.
2. Flooding this surface does not degrade authenticated use or other trigger types — tested under load.
3. Injection and malicious upload attempts are rejected.
4. Rate limiting is enforced per form and in aggregate.

### 50. Chat & Workflow Builder

*The primary interaction: describe a workflow, watch it get built, converse about changes.*

**INPUT** — user messages; workflow state via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — messages to **3. Conversation Manager**; rendered conversation and build progress.

**Carries the first-run experience** (design log Section 19): on first login only, the text box centered with curated templates below and a step-by-step guide. Every subsequent login lands on the most recent chat or a blank slate. Templates are hand-authored, never harvested from user workflows.

**CALL TYPE** — sync, with streaming for in-progress responses.

**DRIVER** — user interaction.
*Driver test:* a described workflow is genuinely built and appears.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Running workflows unaffected.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed on display: never show a workflow state that does not match reality.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Safety & Policy, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not hold workflow state — it renders state owned by the engine.
- Must not show fabricated or placeholder content as real.

**DONE GATE**
1. A described workflow is built and displayed accurately.
2. First-run experience appears once and only once.
3. Displayed state always matches engine state.

---

### 51. Canvas

*The visual graph: view, structural drag-editing, node internals override, materiality pushback, impact analysis. Design log Section 8.*

**INPUT** — the live `WorkflowDAG` via **48. Platform API/BFF**; critique-mode comparisons from **12. Selection & Binding**; validation results from **14. Graph Compiler**.
**OUTPUT** — structural edits and internal overrides written back to the live DAG.

> **The single most important requirement in this contract.** The canvas must read and write the **actual live WorkflowDAG object** — never a separate visual copy reconciled on save. The old build's workflow builder fetched the real workflow, **discarded it**, rendered three hardcoded mock nodes, and on save transmitted an empty graph to a real, working endpoint. Both ends of the wire were real; only the component between them was fake. A user opened their workflow, saw nodes that were not theirs, clicked Save, and their stored DAG was wiped. **This is not a stub that does nothing — it is a stub that writes.**

**Structural editing is unrestricted** (Section 8): reorder, delete, rewire, add placeholder nodes. **Internal overrides are permitted** — the user may change which model, tool, or prompt powers a node — and each materially significant override triggers Alter's informed pushback, produced by **12. Selection & Binding** running in critique mode. Only *material* differences are flagged; trivial ones stay silent, or the pushback becomes noise the user learns to dismiss.

**Impact analysis before any edit goes live** — the same DAG validation from **14. Graph Compiler**, not a duplicate implementation. If an edit affects the stored intake success criteria, ask whether the goal changed too.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — user interaction.
*Driver test:* an edit made on the canvas is genuinely persisted to the live DAG and visible on reload.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only).

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never write a DAG that failed validation. Never save state the canvas did not genuinely load.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit (edits are evidence), Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must never render mock nodes.** Not in development, not as a fallback, not as a loading state that could persist.
- Must not save a graph it did not load from the real DAG.
- Must not duplicate Graph Compiler's validation logic.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Load-then-save round-trips the real DAG unchanged** — the direct test for the old build's data-destruction defect.
2. A structural edit persists and survives reload.
3. A material internal override produces accurate pushback; a trivial one does not.
4. An edit creating a cycle or orphan is rejected before saving.
5. No mock or placeholder node data exists anywhere in this component.

### 52. Run Monitor

*Watch runs live: per-node progress, verification results, run history.*

**INPUT** — live execution progress from **21. Executor** and run history via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — rendered live run view and history.

**Streaming must be real.** The old build's only stream export was a mock adapter with no API-mode branch of any kind — it fabricated deterministic events by pattern-matching the run ID string, while two genuine backends existed and were never called. Its own code admitted the gap in a comment about what a real adapter would do.

**Shows verification results per node** (Section 5), making the engine's checking visible rather than implicit — which is also what makes the thin-UI-first build approach workable, since this is the surface used to verify other components actually work.

**CALL TYPE** — streaming.

**DRIVER** — user opens a run view; events pushed from real execution.
*Driver test:* streamed events match actual run history exactly.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only). Runs execute unwatched.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed on display: show unknown rather than a guessed state.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- **Must never fabricate events.** No pattern-matched, simulated, or interpolated progress.
- Must not infer state it did not receive.

**DONE GATE**
1. **Streamed events match real run history**, compared directly.
2. Per-node verification verdicts are visible.
3. A disconnect and reconnect resumes accurately without gaps or duplicates.
4. No mock adapter exists in this component.

---

### 53. Approval Inbox

*"What is waiting on me" across every workflow. A Platform-side read model over the engine's approval record. Design log Section 22.*

**INPUT** — pending approvals from **25. Approval Store** via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — decisions submitted back to Approval Store.

**Read model, not a store.** The durable decision record — who approved, when, under which mode, promotion history — lives in the engine because it is execution evidence feeding the audit chain and Section 16's promotion logic. This surface presents it and collects decisions.

**Spans runs and workflows**, which is exactly why a run-scoped component could not serve it.

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — user interaction; **arrival driven by 45. Notification**.
*Driver test:* an approval raised during an unattended run appears here and is actionable.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only), but approvals block their runs while unseen.

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed. Never display an approval as decided that was not, and never lose a submitted decision.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not store approval state.
- Must not permit a decision from an unpermitted member — enforcement lives upstream.
- Must not auto-decide on any timeout; timeout behavior belongs to **25. Approval Store**'s configured mode.

**DONE GATE**
1. Approvals from every workflow appear in one place.
2. A permitted member's decision resumes the run; an unpermitted attempt is rejected.
3. All four Section 16 modes display their state correctly.
4. Promotion is offered, never applied silently.

---

### 54. Account & Admin

*Members, roles, connections, budgets, retention settings, billing views.*

**INPUT** — administrative operations from the user via **48. Platform API/BFF**.
**OUTPUT** — operations against **42. Identity & Membership**, **47. Connection & Credential Management**, **44. Deletion & Retention**, **39. Cost Ledger**, and later **43. Billing & Subscription**.

**Also owns the presentation half of workspace organization** (Section 22): folder display names, ordering, sidebar state, search UI — while the ownership facts themselves live in **46. Workspace & Workflow Management**.

**Destructive settings require explicit confirmation** — lowering a retention window is a delete operation wearing a settings label, and must state exactly what will be destroyed before confirming (Section 18).

**CALL TYPE** — sync.

**DRIVER** — user interaction.
*Driver test:* a role change, a connection, and a retention change each take real effect.

**BLAST RADIUS** — degraded (self only).

**FAIL MODE** — fail-closed on every destructive operation.

**PLANE DEPS** — Observability, Audit, Safety & Policy, Type/Schema Contracts.

**NON-RESPONSIBILITIES**
- Must not enforce permissions itself — it presents and submits; enforcement is upstream.
- Must not perform a destructive change without stating its consequence.

**DONE GATE**
1. Role assignment, member invitation, and removal all take real effect.
2. An OAuth connection completes through this surface.
3. Lowering a retention window states what will be destroyed and requires the correct permission.
4. Budget caps set here are genuinely enforced by **16. Run Manager**'s pre-flight gate.
