# Durable Run Queue

**Layer** L6 · **Plane** orchestration · **Category** 1 — works end to end

> **Do not change this component's logic or code during revival.** It is one of the 25 verified

## What it is

Holds queued runs durably between dispatch and pickup, with leases so a worker crash does not strand work, and a dead-letter path for runs that fail repeatedly.

## Blast radius and fail mode

| | |
|---|---|
| Blast radius | `this-layer-only` |
| Fail mode | `fail-closed` |

*Proposed, not ratified.* Design log §29 lists per-component blast radius and fail mode as an open item — *"not yet applied to any specific component list."* These are a first pass, to be confirmed when the component's contract is written.

## Where the code lives

- `apps/orchestration-service/src/runs`

## Current state

*Verbatim from the readiness assessment — engine verified against main 4–6 September 2026; platform reported as received and not independently verified.*

Drained to zero rows across nine dispatches, no stuck leases. Dead-letter cap of five confirmed in source and its regression test, **not by forcing live failures**.

## Design-log alignment — `ALIGNED`

No design-log requirement this component fails.

## What the finished component looks like

- [ ] The dead-letter cap proven by forcing five real consecutive failures, not by reading the constant.
- [ ] A killed worker mid-lease leaves no stranded row.

## Open issues

None.

## Where this sits in the plan

See [`checklist.md`](../../checklist.md).

*Alignment key: `ALIGNED` the design log imposes no requirement this component fails · `NEEDS-LOGIC` the log supplies logic the component is missing · `CONFLICT` the log says something different from the current shape · `SILENT` the log does not cover this component.*
