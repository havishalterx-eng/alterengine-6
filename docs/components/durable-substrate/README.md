# Durable Substrate

## What it is

Temporal. Provides the durable execution guarantees the whole run path rests on: a workflow survives process death and resumes where it stopped.

## Blast radius and fail mode

| | |
|---|---|
| Blast radius | `whole-engine` |
| Fail mode | `fail-closed` |

*Proposed, not ratified.* Design log §29 lists per-component blast radius and fail mode as an open item — *"not yet applied to any specific component list."* These are a first pass, to be confirmed when the component's contract is written.

## Where the code lives

- `apps/background-workers/src/executor`
- `docker-compose.yml`

## Current state

*Verbatim from the readiness assessment — engine verified against main 4–6 September 2026; platform reported as received and not independently verified.*

Every run appears as an `executorWorkflow` and closes `COMPLETED` carrying the node's output.

## Design-log alignment — `ALIGNED`

Locked in design log §7's architecture baseline. The caveat is not correctness but environment — see the done gate.

## What the finished component looks like

- [ ] Task 6.2: local Temporal is `start-dev`, a single process with no persistence guarantees. Moving to Temporal Cloud or a real cluster changes retention, history size limits and worker versioning — all of which the executor workflow currently assumes are generous. Not finished until it runs against a real cluster.

## Open issues

None.

## Where this sits in the plan

See [`checklist.md`](../../checklist.md).

*Alignment key: `ALIGNED` the design log imposes no requirement this component fails · `NEEDS-LOGIC` the log supplies logic the component is missing · `CONFLICT` the log says something different from the current shape · `SILENT` the log does not cover this component.*
