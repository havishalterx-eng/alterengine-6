## What it is

Measures whether the engine is actually any good: golden sets, release gates, chaos scenarios, load suites. The instrument every quality claim depends on.

## Blast radius and fail mode

| | |
|---|---|
| Blast radius | `nothing` |
| Fail mode | `fail-closed` |

*Proposed, not ratified.* Design log §29 lists per-component blast radius and fail mode as an open item — *"not yet applied to any specific component list."* These are a first pass, to be confirmed when the component's contract is written.

## Where the code lives

- `apps/eval-service/src/execution`
- `tests/load/k6`

## Current state

*Verbatim from the readiness assessment — engine verified against main 4–6 September 2026; platform reported as received and not independently verified.*

The last tier-2 service, and it now runs. All three RPCs answer. `RunEvaluation` executed a real 30-case golden set to completion and persisted a scored result for every case; `CheckReleaseGate` read that run back and returned NotFound for an unknown one; `RecordPromotionDecision` returned approved for a complete evidence bundle and blocked with the precise cause for each incomplete one (`metric_failed:intent:0.8>=0.95`, `missing_approval:ceo`), each with its own evidence digest. Unauthenticated calls are refused.

**The 30-case run scored 0 of 30, and that is the right answer rather than a broken harness**: every case recorded a specific reason, all of them the injection screen inside `ClassifyIntent` failing to reach ads-core, which was not running.

## Design-log alignment — `ALIGNED`

The 0/30 is design log §11 landing. The log rejected safety-as-a-standalone-service and named this exact failure mode: *safety checks fire constantly, so a network hop on every one turns that service into a new single point of failure every gateway depends on.* Thirty cases failing on one unreachable dependency is that prediction arriving.

## What the finished component looks like

- [ ] A 30-case golden set scores above zero **for a real reason** — the Phase 1 done gate.
- [ ] Planner and architecture golden sets written **before** the Phase 4 rewrites, so the target is fixed in advance rather than fitted afterwards.
- [ ] Chaos scenarios, load suites and the nine metric floors run against something real (task 6.5).

## Open issues

None.

## Where this sits in the plan

See [`checklist.md`](../../checklist.md).

*Alignment key: `ALIGNED` the design log imposes no requirement this component fails · `NEEDS-LOGIC` the log supplies logic the component is missing · `CONFLICT` the log says something different from the current shape · `SILENT` the log does not cover this component.*
