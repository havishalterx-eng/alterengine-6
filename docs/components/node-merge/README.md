## What it is

Converges parallel branches back into one path after a fan-out.

## Blast radius and fail mode

| | |
|---|---|
| Blast radius | `degraded` |
| Fail mode | `fail-closed` |

*Proposed, not ratified.* Design log §29 lists per-component blast radius and fail mode as an open item — *"not yet applied to any specific component list."* These are a first pass, to be confirmed when the component's contract is written.

## Where the code lives

- `apps/orchestration-service/src/registry`

## Current state

*Verbatim from the readiness assessment — engine verified against main 4–6 September 2026; platform reported as received and not independently verified.*

Converged the diamond and, critically, **completed without waiting for the branch the Gate had deactivated** — the deadlock every fan-out/fan-in design risks.

## Design-log alignment — `ALIGNED`

No design-log requirement this component fails.

## What the finished component looks like

Nothing outstanding. This component meets every requirement the design log places on it, and the assessment exercised it live. Its definition of done is that current behaviour holds.

## Open issues

None.

## Where this sits in the plan

See [`checklist.md`](../../checklist.md).

*Alignment key: `ALIGNED` the design log imposes no requirement this component fails · `NEEDS-LOGIC` the log supplies logic the component is missing · `CONFLICT` the log says something different from the current shape · `SILENT` the log does not cover this component.*
