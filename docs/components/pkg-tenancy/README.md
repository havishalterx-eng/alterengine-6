# tenancy package

**Layer** package · **Plane** packages · **Category** 5 — not assessable yet

> Nothing has called this. It is neither known-good nor known-broken, and it has not earned a

## What it is

Shared tenant-identity primitives and the RLS context helpers.

## Blast radius and fail mode

| | |
|---|---|
| Blast radius | `whole-engine` |
| Fail mode | `fail-closed` |

*Proposed, not ratified.* Design log §29 lists per-component blast radius and fail mode as an open item — *"not yet applied to any specific component list."* These are a first pass, to be confirmed when the component's contract is written.

## Where the code lives

- `packages/tenancy`

## Current state

*Verbatim from the readiness assessment — engine verified against main 4–6 September 2026; platform reported as received and not independently verified.*

**Libraries with unit tests rather than services with edges to misconfigure — the least worrying entries in this category.** Exercised transitively by everything in Category 1.

## Design-log alignment — `NEEDS-LOGIC`

Design log §7 pattern 4 is aimed squarely at packages like these: *duplicated primitives drifting apart — two ID validators, empty stub packages — single source of truth per shared primitive, enforced.* The old build shipped exactly that defect. The Cost Ledger's two tenant-ID formats are a live instance today, which is a `tenancy` concern as much as a Cost Ledger one. §26's rename (Identity & Tenant Gateway, Workspace & Workflow Management) is binding across code as well as documents.

## What the finished component looks like

- [ ] One definition per shared primitive, enforced by a gate rather than by discipline (task C1).
- [ ] No empty stub package survives.

## Open issues

None.

## Where this sits in the plan

See [`checklist.md`](../../checklist.md).

*Alignment key: `ALIGNED` the design log imposes no requirement this component fails · `NEEDS-LOGIC` the log supplies logic the component is missing · `CONFLICT` the log says something different from the current shape · `SILENT` the log does not cover this component.*
