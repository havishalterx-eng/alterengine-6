# Verification & Quality Gate

**Layer** L8 · **Plane** verification · **Category** 1 — works end to end

> **Do not change this component's logic or code during revival.** It is one of the 25 verified

## What it is

Judges whether a node's output actually did what it was supposed to. The component the entire verified-run billing claim rests on.

## Blast radius and fail mode

| | |
|---|---|
| Blast radius | `whole-engine` |
| Fail mode | `fail-closed` |

*Proposed, not ratified.* Design log §29 lists per-component blast radius and fail mode as an open item — *"not yet applied to any specific component list."* These are a first pass, to be confirmed when the component's contract is written.

## Where the code lives

- `apps/verification-service/src/verification`

## Current state

*Verbatim from the readiness assessment — engine verified against main 4–6 September 2026; platform reported as received and not independently verified.*

Both paths real. A promoted tenant policy moved the threshold 0.7 to 0.95 on the next call, flipping identical output from pass to warn.

## Design-log alignment — `NEEDS-LOGIC`

Design log §5 specifies **three things that are not evidenced anywhere in the assessment**:

- **§5.1 intake requirement.** Before any workflow runs, a structured statement of what success looks like must be captured from the user. Every later check is judged against it.
- **§5.2 mechanical check.** Confirm the real external system reflects the claimed action — read the Slack channel back, read the sheet back. *Never trust "the API call returned success" alone.* This is the exact class of bug that broke the old build's workflow builder.
- **§5.3 end-of-run holistic check.** Even after every node passes individually, compare the combined outcome against the original success criteria.

The current gate judges nodes against their own sub-tasks — that is §5.3's semantic half only. **Absence of the other three is inferred, not established** (task C12): nobody looked for them. Check before scheduling; if genuinely missing this is a subsystem, not a patch.

§5.4 reviewer isolation is also required — output being judged is passed as clearly-marked data, never as an instruction the reviewer could act on. That closes the old build's audited confused-deputy flaw.

## What the finished component looks like

- [ ] Structured success criteria captured at intake and stored (§5.1).
- [ ] Mechanical read-back after every node that touches an external system (§5.2).
- [ ] End-of-run holistic check against those criteria (§5.3).
- [ ] Reviewer isolation proven with a hostile output that tries to instruct its own reviewer (§5.4).
- [ ] Fail-closed on timeout or error: counted as unverified, never as success (§5.5).

## Open issues

None.

*Alignment key: `ALIGNED` the design log imposes no requirement this component fails · `NEEDS-LOGIC` the log supplies logic the component is missing · `CONFLICT` the log says something different from the current shape · `SILENT` the log does not cover this component.*
