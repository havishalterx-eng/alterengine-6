# progress.md — Project Revive

Terse log of what actually got done. One line per completed item, newest last. Reasoning
and evidence live in [`memoryalter.md` §4](memoryalter.md#4-progress-context).

**A line only appears here when something was demonstrated, not when it was reported.**
A builder saying a thing works is not a reason to write a line. The Adversary running it,
or a live demonstration, is.

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD · task · what was demonstrated · who verified`

## 2026-09-08

- `2026-09-08 · setup · repo alterengine-6 created; memoryalter.md, checklist.md, progress.md written · CEO session`
- `2026-09-08 · phase 0 · all five decisions answered, design log §30–§33 appended, no code changed · CEO session`
- `2026-09-08 · 1.1 · Bedrock Titan v2 reachable in ap-south-1 as user/alterengine.dev; live 512-dim embedding returned · verified by real invoke-model call`
- `2026-09-08 · 1.0 · full stack up from committed config: 26 services, 47 ports, all answering · verified by real HTTP+gRPC responses, not container state`
- `2026-09-08 · 1.0 · two-node workflow dispatched through the real Executor; upstream output reached the second node · verified live`
- `2026-09-08 · 1.0 · regression check written and proven to fail by stopping redis · committed, NOT yet wired into CI (C16)`
- `2026-09-08 · 1.1 · real embeddings discriminate: relevant 0.8600 vs nonsense 0.1214/0.0757 against threshold 0.6; no re-tuning needed · verified live, four real calls`

## Where things stand

**Phase 0 closed.** All five decisions answered with rationale, no code changed. Derived
logic in design log §30–§33.

**Phase 1 in progress.** 1.0 running. 1.1 verified live — credentials, region and Titan
access all confirmed by real call. 1.2 prompt ready. 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 not started.

**3.0** (auto-creation idempotency) prompt ready, waits on 1.0 finishing.
