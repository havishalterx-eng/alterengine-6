// ENGINE-FIX-P3-17: relocated here from
// apps/platform-api/src/notifications/notification.module.ts so every
// service that needs a real EmailProvider (platform-api's notification
// module, tool-gateway's email.send tool action) resolves it identically
// instead of each hand-rolling its own copy of this same env-var-switch +
// mock-in-production-is-fatal logic -- exactly the kind of duplicated
// environment-validation logic this repo's own audit history already
// flagged as tech debt.
//
// Originally: was raw SES_FROM_ADDRESS/SES_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_REF presence
// sniffing -- both vars absent fell through to MockEmailProvider silently
// in any environment including production, with no fatal check at all.
// EMAIL_PROVIDER drives an explicit switch instead: "ses" missing its
// paired config throws instead of silently downgrading; mock is fatal
// when NODE_ENV=production.
//
// Takes the secret resolver as a parameter (matching SesEmailProvider's
// own constructor) rather than importing one service's own secret-
// resolution helper directly -- platform-api's is identity.module.ts's
// resolveRuntimeSecret, tool-gateway has no equivalent of that module at
// all (it resolves secrets through its own injected SecretsProvider
// instead) -- so this stays portable across services with no
// platform-api-specific dependency, and neither service duplicates the
// other's secret-resolution mechanism.
