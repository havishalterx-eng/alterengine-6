/**
 * Callers that ask this provider for a specific JSON shape parse the reply
 * against that shape and fail closed when it does not match, so a mock that
 * always answers in prose blocks them all. Verification cannot score a node,
 * recovery cannot estimate a root cause, and a local run stops at the first
 * gate that needs an opinion from a model.
 *
 * Each entry below is matched against the request's own instruction text and
 * mirrors a contract that a caller states in its prompt. The verdicts are
 * deliberately benign -- a passing score, no hallucination, low severity, no
 * injection -- so a run proceeds far enough to exercise the path.
 *
 * The ceiling: these are fixed answers keyed off the prompt, not a model. A
 * test that needs a specific verdict should inject its own `invoke` through
 * MockModelProviderOptions rather than adding a branch here, and anything
 * asserting real model judgement belongs against a real provider.
