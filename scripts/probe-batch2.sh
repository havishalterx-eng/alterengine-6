# Batch 2 probes -- the Tier 2 leaf services, each of which needs one database
# and no sibling service.
#
# These are database-level probes. They assert what the schema and its policies
# actually enforce, which is a real and checkable property, and they do NOT
# assert application behaviour -- that needs the services running and is Batch 3
# onward. Each probe says which of the two it is.
#
# Every probe creates its own rows and removes them, so this is independent of
# scripts/seed-local.sh and safe to re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   set -a; . ./.env.local; set +a
#   sh scripts/probe-batch2.sh
set -eu
